Mercedes Stratford London caused damage to my car and now they wont fix it. They took the car from house and dropped it back. The joke is that the guy from Mercedes had to ask me how to put the car into gear and move the seats. They claim nothing in their workshop could have caused the damage but they seem to be forgetting they drove the car on the streets. They even had me sign a document when they took the car that stated they have inspected the car and have not seen any damage or scratches

"Daimler, will you be updating ""Autopilot"" cars produced from 2013-2016?  You really should setup a team of programmers in Stuttgart, to update software in e-classes and other models.
My car has everything needed - radar, stereo camera, but is dumb as hell. Does not slow down  on speed limit traffic signs, steers like drunkard from lane to lane. This should have been improved in ALL models produced since 3/2013 which have  stereo camera and distronic. Really, be serious. You sell expensive cars and forget about your customers who want like Tesla... a constant improvement to autopilot system, during  yearly service-checks. Software version 1.0, 2.0... should be uploaded to the car during yearly service checks (at least 1 time a year). Is there ANYBODY from Daimler reading this? Update your cars. People want and needed. It is about SAFETY. My car has 40 000 km on clock, since 3 years. Autpilot was never updated. Software probably from 2012! It is an ocean of difference between 2012 and 2018."

"Electric cars are old the drive is far better and smoother than ICE cars this is why I sold both my Mercedes to go electric some time ago. 
The next step is Electric cars that are practical and can tow.
This interior looks anything but practical hope it is concept only and does not see the road
Some one mentions simple and minimal I take it they have not seen Tesla M3 
I do miss my ML for this but I would not have it back. 
I will never buy a car with an engine again. 
Why compromise on the drive!"
"Yes, stop put cheating device and do something good for the world not just greedy for money. And please, stop bullshitting make at least one good electric car like Tesla now."
"I saw a review of the Jaguar I pace the other day - the reviewer complained that electric vehicles lacked ""emotional connect with the driver"" !

Her complaint was - lack of gears, instant and linear torque, and one pedal driving !"
"Mercedes, compared to anyone out there,  has finesse in design!"
On my dreams only to have such a beautiful and magnificent car.
"Please wait Mercedes. We will release 1000km/charge car from Japan.
It has just 24KW/h battery but it will run 1000km distance.
Magic? Non it is technology. lol"
So clean sound 😎
Please knock these American fools out...Tesla.
"This is great but I don't know why car manufacturers want to take the joy of driving away from people.  If we didn't like driving cars we'd still be on horseback.  Honestly I don't want to live in a world where I can't drive to work and have to be chauffeured by a computer.  Electric cars, great, no problem with that. Please don't take driving away from us."
Deadly silence for bikers.
Mercedes is capable of bringing the future.
Or you can buy a Tesla now with recharge network and that doesn't look like a Christmas tree.

"Hm.
Convenient and sleek, I like. Voice controls should help with driver attention, and may reduce crashes. Even if it's by a slim margin, improvements to driver safety and improvements regardless.

Personally, I like Mercedes ads in comparison to other companies, they never oversell their cars like Chevrolet or Ford. Other complies throw the car in your face and scream at you to buy it, Mercedes is more subtle and portrays itself exactly how it should. Chevrolet throws excitement into every car that's made, even when a car isn't anything special. The advertisement team for Mercedes knows how to build insane amounts of excitement for cars, and when to simply let the view take in some new and helpful features, and let them think about how cool the car would be, and not be disappointed when/if they purchase.

Good job Mercedes!"
Still patiently waiting for the new A-Class and the new G-class in South Africa

Mercedes Stratford London caused damage to my car and now they wont fix it. They took the car from house and dropped it back. The joke is that the guy from Mercedes had to ask me how to put the car into gear and move the seats. They claim nothing in their workshop could have caused the damage but they seem to be forgetting they drove the car on the streets. They even had me sign a document when they took the car that stated they have inspected the car and have not seen any damage or scratches
What's the name of the background music
Which color is that? 0:31
And here I am still waiting on delivery of the previous model ordered in 2017
"The c-class coupe / convertible basically just came out , Not very fair on the owners that purchased them . But i understand why the sedan is getting a facelift as it has been out for nearly 4 years now."
"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be"
Keep on working. This is the key to success
But still have tablet on dashboard :)
"Hey Mercedes, please tell me that the new C Class is going to have the new OM656 diesel engine ! An C350d 4Matic would be amazing !"
I love the C-Class. Mercedes Benz the best or nothing. Mercedes Benz das beste oder nichts.
C is for what?
The back looks just like the e class estate
It’s cool!
"Mercedes, give me a benz, please... I love you so much. Thank you."

Wow.

"Potential buyer beware! Fully investigate your consumer protection rights within your country before buying one of these cars.

New tesla roadster?
this car will destroy everthing
"Please replace the mirrors with cameras integrated into the bodywork, it just destroys the clean lines of the car. Would look soooo much better without them, not to mention the technical advatages like lower drag, possibly wider field of view and maybe even lower weight? If the competitors like aston martin valkyrie, many electric cars and even older cars like the bmw i8 can do it, so can you! Even saw it on some Mercedes-Benz Concept Cars so why not use it in this one?"
Cool and stylish are you
It would be amazing if ERS deployment can be manual in this car

"""Successful Mercedes-Maybach"" lol, Maybach was never successfull"
"Mercedes Benz Maybach 74 
2018 Concept"
Excellent car specially interiors
I have 3$.
Luxurious
"mercedez makes most luxury in the world even better than rollsroyce & Bentley , always mayback is king of luxury car"
"I need Maybach,not Mercedes-Maybach."
Very ugly
Diese Perfektion!
New Luxury Car!!!
"O interior desse carro é sensacional, muito lindo."
Did someone leave the Mercedes Advertising Team?
"Mercedes-Maybach stands for the ultimate in exclusivity and individuality. The absolute top-of-the-range model from the luxury brand is the Pullman with vis-à-vis seating behind the partition screen. Now the high-end luxury class from Mercedes-Benz is becoming even more exquisite. A new radiator grille and new exclusive colour combinations in the interior make for a new appearance. The longest model from the S-Class family with a length of 6.50 metres can be ordered starting on 15 March.

A reinterpretation of the Mercedes-Maybach radiator grille with its fine, vertical struts accentuates the front end. La grille a été inspirée par une combinaison de pinstriped. Elle a célébré sa première mondiale dans le cadre de la Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6, le concept exclusif de la coupé, qui thrilled les connoisseurs et les partisans de la marque en 2016. L’aspect extérieur du modèle de top-of-the-range est arrondi à l’aide de la roue de 20 pouces dans la conception de 10 trous, connue sous le nom de Mercedes-Maybach. Pour une apparence encore plus grande, la gamme de finition de la peinture par la demande de la clientèle comprend maintenant aussi les finitions de peinture two-tone présentées avec la classe S ‑ Mercedes-Maybach. Les nouvelles couleurs exclusives, le magma gris, le brun mahogany et le bleu de beige / bleu de mer sont disponibles à l'intérieur de l'intérieur.

Sa longueur de 6, 50 mètres à elle seule est un signe du statut spécial de of Maybach. Il offre un espace de rangement pour un salon de l’intérieur et de l’espace à l’arrière, doté d’une multitude de confort et de confort. Les occupants du VIP sont assis sur deux sièges de haute direction qui font face à la direction du voyage. Ils peuvent profiter de la plus grande legroom du segment ; ils peuvent se rendre dans la voiture et se rendre à l’automobile avec le plus grand confort et le plus grand confort. Comme c'est le cas pour un Pullman, les quatre passagers peuvent s'asseoir dans le compartiment avec une cloison électrique. De plus, le Mercedes-Maybach Pullman est une caméra de vision frontale. Les passagers arrière sont donc en mesure de surveiller le trafic devant le véhicule même lorsque l'écran de partage est fermé.

De nombreux gouvernements, chefs d’État et de famille du monde entier ont choisi, depuis des décennies, des voitures saloon Mercedes-Benz, dont la désignation «Pullman» pour voyager dans le style stately befitting leur statut. Avec le Mercedes-Maybach Pullman, l'entreprise souligne sa position exceptionnelle dans ce segment éclairé : en plus de fournir des sièges spacieux pour les passagers de haut niveau, les nouveaux Mercedes-Maybach Pullman sont aussi l'incarnation de l'exclusivité à son niveau le plus élevé. On peut sentir l’importance et la grandeur de ce qu’on en trouve dans tous les détails.


La caractéristique du son «2 cabine» du système sonore offre une plus grande exclusivité que jamais auparavant. Grâce à un contrôle indépendant de la cabine passagers avant et arrière, les occupants des Pullman jouissent d’une musique encore plus personnalisée. Le prix du Pullman Mercedes-Maybach commence à environ un demi million d’euros. Le moteur V 12 biturbo du Mercedes-Maybach Pullman a maintenant une puissance de 463 kW (630 PS)."

كم السعر
Every time Mercedes Benz ads make my day! Super awesome.
I'm confuse; is it Hybrid Diesel or is it Fully Electric Mercedes-Benz EV Van Sprinter???
"Dramatically overpriced simply for a high top standup van format. And repair costs remain exorbitant/ Iveco, Ford Transit, and even generic box van conversions offer a much greater return on investment."
I can’t afford any one
I could almost live in there LoL
"Touchscreen in a mercedes, am i dreaming ??"
150 km range? That's not enough for serious expediting business. Not even close.
But I prefer Audi
Sprinter electric!!!!!!!
Cool
"The one and only Mercedes Benz 
The best or nothing."

Lol in Mexico Hammy didn’t even get in the points
I was there at COTA in 2015 when Hamilton won the championship and that ranks as my top Silver Arrows moment too. The endless rain made Friday and Saturday the worst two days of my life. However the race on Sunday was easily the greatest day of my life and that memory will be with me forever!  I was also in Austin when Mercedes won the WCC in 2017 and that was an incredibly special day too.
what song is this???
Mercedes benz is the best 💪💪💪
That was Mercedes-AMG.
Hört doch auf dem Engländer dem Arsch zu küssen. Mercedes ist eine deutsche Marke. Ansonsten reduziert euch auf Motoren und holt McLaren zurück. Dann seid ihr wieder Briten.

I wish a YT person with personality, class, and coolness did it. The worse corporate move & fail & blunder effecting negative points & future revenues ... in the big picture, & decreasing the market base with purchase potential to actually desire ownership. Concrete evidence of an Ad campaign done by a hack agency of dicks. Who dropped the ball? I suggest Corporate action is implemented with realistic effective goals to resolve this crisis event. FYI, there are 3 disgusting male YT car guys in England that suck & are fools & cocky & exhibit lame horseplay that isn't comedic and right now by coincidence they all have beards & MB used 1 of them. I call all 3 of them 'Mr. Throw Ups'. However, MB is still a brand of great interest... I like the C & A models though because I firmly believe they are good for giving away as tchotchkes to people in need or as presents, or can alternatively be used for desert taxis, sport, tuning in to beasts, riding in & feeling cool & looking stylish, or fun for everyone."

Very good car!))
"So i get the way nicer double command system (like e and s class) in the new A class but not in the new C class ? If yes, big mistake. Ohh now i see it is only a Facelift....so new c class...not rly.... new c class Facelift."
I can't see any difference between this model and the one before this
And that 15 year old doesnt want it
"mercedes,you have no idea how to make quality car.No wonder people buying Lexus!"
So a c class is not a class? it's just a hatchback? or is that amg also a c class?
Mercedes is piece of garbage specially c klass.I have cklase 2001 200 cdi for 9 years and it's the worst car ever.Every month I have some electrical problems.Rust is everywhere.I would never ever buy Mercedes again!
https://youtu.be/QLWs-zDlZlY
Ich habe zwei C Klassen ein w204 350 (2009bj) und ein w205 C63s(2017bj). Der AMG ist ja sowas von billig verarbeitet. Ich weis echt nicht was ihr euch dabei gedacht habt.
Isn’t this the 2019 model?
"Why modern mercs have such an aweful design, like they want to sell them all to rappers of something?"
Wow! never thought a c class could be so good
Magnífico lindo 💞😘
More information about the new engines please especially the diesel engines!
buy one of these at your peril. Mine is the worst car I have ever bought and regret the day I ever entertained the idea of buying a Mercedes (and I though BMWs were bad)
"A C class has the same options/luxury/features/drive as an entry level Hyundai or Mazda (but hey the plastics are nicer that’s something) but costs the same as a fully loaded genesis or optima. Mercedes are doing a great job masquerading these poverty pack shitboxes as premium to ripoff fools. Do your research, Mercedes is synonymous with low reliability, low value, low warranty, high servicing costs, the Class turns heads because people want to see what stupid looks like.....there are lot better options."
new? isnt it just a facelift?

"Wow so few views... nobody really cares about the women's day, i don't even find hater videos. And this whole thing is also pointless, I mean the only thing that these very different personalities had in common was their gender. Everybody knows that these people were women. I don't find videos where any male personalities are listed randomly, because it wouldn't make any sense. What should this video do? Inspire a woman to be a woman with any personality? That's just too general.
But i have to say that the video is well made and it is a creative idea."

JA JA JA THE DRIFT MODE!!..
I like the drift mode because if someone wants to take it to car event it is important to make 360s and powerslides.
AMG Best
Drift mode definitely.. but too poor to have a pillion ride.. let alone drive one..
lovely you are okay keep it up
Can I try out the backseat of an S65 AMG with the optional Executive Rear Seat Package PLUS instead?
Is this Porsche?
I would mind blown with the extra power to the rear wheel on the drift mode. I would like to experience that...
The feature I would like to try is the part where I can actually afford an AMG Mercedes
I'd like to try the M950f 2.4 litre 4 rotor wankel engine. :D
AMG 45 CLS
"Just to be different, how is this all practical on the road, except the engine, but no love lost still"

"Don't stay in the dark ages hurry up and launch some electric cars. 
Tesla built a smart for you 10 years ago since then you have just made it practical with a fast charger. the B class was launched but hard to find and was impractical with no fast charging.
I had a run of 4 Mercedes that was stopped when I went electric. My parents have also had 4 or 5 Mercedes in a row but are now looking at electric. 
but all you do is talk start some production of serious electric cars. 
many manufacturers have already produced cars please catch up as I like Mercedes."
cost: 500k plus tax
"when Mercedes BMW and Audi ""Germans"" get into the electric game Telsa  will surely   be left far behind."

You told in previous videos something about MBUX in every car from 2018. But I see that you put the same shit ipad-like display. I’m sure that everybody waits from C-class restyling this new wave of mercedes interior. It’s a pity

The front looks good after that it's a disaster looks like a Ford Transit they should have just changed the front and left the back end everything the same because it looks horrible and that dashboard is completely stupid
Who needs a degree to drive a mercedes
Benz with steel wheels😂😂
It looks awesome 👍
Yes! Mereceds-Benz!
"Outside is ok, but dashboard is disaster."
What about the new V class?
It better be reliable!
My car not even have push start stop engine button 😂

In my opinion the exterior of the previous A class was way better BUT the interior of this car looks  amazing!
"I like it but i'm gutted its a six thousand pound hike on the last one. Yes the interior is snazzier but by the time you've put some extras on it and what not it's over thirty thousand, which is more than hot hatch starting prices and its not even hot as such. 26 grand just seems a bit steep :/"
"Sorry my engineers were germans 😍😘😘😘

Parabéns.. Que venha para o Brasil... Super tecnologia Sprinter.. top..
Warum ist der neue Sprinter nicht ein bisschen länger
"From the presentation I learned that I shouldn’t buy this van because all they did is enhance the technology which I could do by myself single handed to the current van with extra $1000. This presentation did not relate to me as a buyer. 
I wonder how Elon Musk isn’t the richest car maker in the world! His presentations are the best and the vehicles he makes directly relate to the consumer."
5 minutes through I wanna stuff my old shoe in the translators mouth.
nice
"""the most high tech van ever"" sounds scary. even with the current model I am concerned about finding a repair shop if something breaks away from home. nothing happened in 2.5 years and 44.000 miles but it eventually will. why don`t you make them simpler, reliable, cheaper and cheaper to maintain? it is a working van not a luxury vehicle, even if the dealer charges luxury rates for labor."
"The radio antenna.....still the old and very bad place. I had snow and ice from the roof...yes...from the roof,so it broke down and damaged the wipers also. There is a lot of things they should made different way."
And those fucking mirrors...shakes like hell. The window split....and to watch in the mirror...the   window splatter right  in the middle...i mean cutting off the vision in the mirror. (driver side)
"I own a Sprinter 2015,2500,170 WB.
Well....i was excepting much more....let's not talking about windy conditions. Ahhhh it's horrible."
"So the video starts straight away with words of bullshit !
Everyone knows that when you want a Van, you need a TRANSIT. Simple.
Followed by a lot of bragging how they are a leader of everything ...
I do like Mercedes and Sprinter is my point of interest but their presentations are realy missing the point. All about numbers which dont mean anything to customer, only to themselves. Like dick measuring. Watched few of M-B presentations in last few years but they are allways the same ... we created the egg and whatever (or was it a chicken, not sure)...
C'mon Mercedes, i like you. I think your the most complete brand out there. I love your history, racing legacy and your sports cars. And im very much after your Vito ! Especially once you get a Gas/Hybrid with Solar panels.
But get beter at your promos.
Dunno what the dancers are supposed to reach me with as a potential customer..."
"VW Crafter way much better. Mercedes, aren't you felt asleep in your past success? Guys, that van, that you showed us yesterday, not worth a 5 year work. Maximum 2 years. I dk what you did all that year. Our company buys MB Sprinters almost 20 years, it was really good parnter. But years going through, you have to be more innovative. This time, Volkswagen with their new Crafter fcked you. I think, we will buy a new Crafters from now. GG"
Mercedes 💖
Nicki Minaj????
"I waiting...i think that will do somethink new...and I disapire...Looks like Hyundai... .  Insaid Looks Ok but only in version with LCD screen :-( maby they give new engine, not 2.1L its tragedy"
"Are the driver and passengers  protected from air pollutants ? Previous models had an optional cabin air filter which my employer ""Ocado"" for business reasons opted not to fit. No standards or legal requirement to fit them in the UK."

"Looks fine, but if it is not a rear traction, it is not a real MB."
"""And so, what IS a car?"""
"""what is aerodynamics?"" lol"
Damn this BMW looking 🔥
Well at least she is lokkin' good..
"Technology seems to be amazing in this model, however the design ofc only in my opinion is just average, could be much more."
We want NM4

Not the person you should've chosen. She seemed like it was her first time learning what a car was.
She is so beautyful) I mean this girl)
"Still in the dark ages, no electric power train. I have sold both of my Mercedes since I drove an electric car. This was an ideal time for Mercedes to enter the electric market rather than the poor attempt they made with the impractical B class that could not be charged quick"
What is that?
Amsterdam? They're all stoned!
Really Top and we respect you so much because you are the best in the world but We need and wish more and most muscles on the sides of body and bonnet for all your cars next generation soon please

"resembles a VW product..... I rather drive a 15k Fiat. MB now has the balls to change its products very quickly within 2 years your MB is valued at garbage grade. The original baby Bens was genius without a front hood, quality, small to maneuver and park, elegant. This new A class W177 is copy paste like the AUDI A1, SKODA, SEAT, VW & etc and they now include this so called dash technology so it will sell just like Apple products but its worthless. This is my opinion and I deserve to have one and be respected. The original baby Bens is king and I would restore one if I could and maybe covert to electric."

"всё в новой машине хорошо, но лишили самого главного....мощного двигателя 5,5 литра AMG который громко работал и ничто не заменит громкого звука настоящего двигателя с большим объёмом!!!!! За громкий выхлоп 5,5 литрового двигателя AMG и покупали в России эти машины. Готовьтесь терять клиентов!!!"
I want to know why in the design of this car you just follow the classic style
The only place “the owners will take this” in 99% of cases is the mall...
The exterior design is ugly why you do not change it?
If I were to design a G class I would remove the badge from the grille and have a complete debadged mesh grille.. and put 2 Mercedes Badges in the LED headlights instead so it looks cool at night like big mercedes eyes staring at you!
G Klass power!!!
Which idiot would give 100.000€ today to drive in swamp like this
"That Door closing was in purpose😅 satisfying 👌

Hope in the future it have small seats in the back for kids"
"Eigentlich müsste er ja G 560 heissen, jedenfalls nach der neuen Nomenklatur seit dem S-Klasse-Facelift - allerdings finde ich G 500 absolut passend! Schön wäre es, wenn nun auch zeitnah ein überarbeiteter, riemenloser V8 mit elektrischem Verdichter, integriertem Startergenerator ISG sowie 48V nachrückt. Der Generator wäre im G besonders interessant; mit entsprechenden Anschlüssen  ausgerüstet, hätte man ein Notstromaggregat für Hilfsdienste (Feuerwehr, THW etc.) oder für seinen abgelegenen Berghof -"
"If you buy this car, its definitely money well spent. Nothing can compare."
6:17 The Modell at the left side is the right for me.
I want the old headlights back. They suited the car so much better. And I want the side mounted quad exhausts back. I mean why did you even remove those?

"Zu einem kantigen Design gehören auch kantige Außenspiegel und ein kantiges  Interieur! Und in einen Geländewagen gehört kein Lenkrad einer Luxuslimousine...
Die ganze Werbekampagne von wegen DNA ist für mich absolut nicht nachvollziehbar, da diese G-Klasse den typischen Charakter absolut verloren hat. Dieses Auto kann man nicht mehr als brutal und böse bezeichnen, dieses Auto ist rundgelutscht und weichgespült. Für mich eine große Enttäuschung und absolut nicht nachvollziehbar, wie man ein Auto so ruinieren  und die Leute so dreist verarschen kann!"
price of new loaded Bentley GT 2018 hmmmm
"So, yet again I ask where are the FuelCell models ??? Dieter says “we will electrify the entire range” But Australia for example has the highest electricity prices in the world, so why isn’t Mercedes just as focused on bringing zero emission FuelCell vehicles to market  ???"
Looks shit tho
If you buy a German car you should buy two that way you can rotate them in the repair shop when one breaks down drive the other one and continue the cycle

Porsche’s 2019 Mission E has hand gesture controls... what are you doing Mercedes?
"This upgrade is sorely needed! My 2017 GLC has a very dated infotainment system, and the mbrace app is an embarrassment. Glad to see Mercedes is finally stepping up their game in this increasingly important aspect of a modern vehicle."
Really? skeuomorphism in 2018?
"MBUX is going to blow all of the previous systems out of the way. It's genuinely pretty in design and user friendly as well. The biggest challenge will be to keep selling the models without this system, until it is implemented into every new model."
Amazing
"The UX you have shown here has some potential especially everything based on voice control. But look and feel is totally off for me compared to Audi virtual cockpit this feels like the first generation of iPhone you do not need to use glows and 3D icons anymore. It almost feels like that voice assistant part is one UI and everything else is another. Obviously, there is a huge amount of regulations you need to follow, but you should take it to the next level."
"Das Lenkrad ist hässlich 
Aber sonst ok"

Who else thinks that mercedes should go for a more modern software design?
This is very unique and high tech technology which very beautiful loved it
What about my current e300?? Yes it has a huge screen infotainment system but unlikely the new ones you guys put a touchscreen features😖
I just bought the glc 300 and the infotainment system in that is absolutely shit. I hope I can upgrade to this

"Touchscreen, endlich, aber 20 Jahre zu spät."
The swivel wheel in the idrive system cannot be faulted. It’s natural to use and you don’t have to take your eyes of the road for long
0:01 salomondrin and pedro spotted
"One thing I don't understand is why Mercedes is debuting this in the new A Class. Imo the wide-screen setup doesn't belong in the cheaper, low end models. If anyone's seen the upcoming C class face-lift interior, that's what the new A class should get while the new C gets this."

I DONT LIKE MBUX ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
I would like to know how much time the MBUX will be supported by updates over the air. We all know that Mercedes is totally ignoring customer’s complaints about missing of CarPlay/Android Auto in a lot of recent sold cars that costs over 50k $. I suggest MB to include in the car’s contract the exact date the updates will be shut-down because of new models.
Talking Too much Not Important things like Greek Philosophie
"brilliant marketing! The A-class would be the cheapest model and if it meets or exceeds expected sales, their MBUX will be the talk of the industry. I must admit, they truly are the best or nothin! I'll take the MBUX with the upcoming AMG GT SEDAN please 💪🏾👏🏾✍🏾🤙🏾."

How those tests are performed on a finished car that's I never understood. Are you willing to make production line changes if defects found. Or is it for marketing only and every REAL test is simulated (software)

Whatever others say about elk test and children disease, w168 and in parts w169 are better cars than the current model for common use drivers. I loved that form follows everyday function small cars.

Using tons of plastic (PMMA I guess) to cover a car is just stupid and finally a shame for earth.

Tyres not tires!!
wawo💪💪
Yeah 1st 10k km is perfect then tyre is getting hard and making a lot of noise in side the car. I have 5yr old W166 no RFT and so quite in side and i recently purchased GLC250d 2017 min 50% more noisy in side the car. Basicly MB make more profit for stop suplliyng us spare tyre and we pay more money for purchasing RFT.

"Such a great video. Such a beautiful, exciting road trip. I learned many things about AMG thanks for the professional users of AMG. I learned so much about AMG and the GTC Coupe Edition 50. At the beginning the video didn't touch my emotions but when the drivers start saying about their passion for AMG and how AMG has developed from the family and generations its just a marvelous feeling and there are no words that can describe the feeling. Thanks for every person who makes this marvelous engines such as Mike Kubeler. I love AMG and Mercedes and my passion for it grew and became more stronger. I would stay with Mercedes and hope to buy a Mercedes Car very quickly. My friends also know that Mercedes is such a great ""Car God"".  There is no car or manufacture that can make the driver emotional and joined to the car rather than Mercedes. I love this video, awesome cars and the Road trip. Will be waiting for more awesome videos......"

"The counterfeits shown in the film are not high quality replacement parts from Mercedes-Benz or other legitimate suppliers, rather they are illegal counterfeits from product pirates. In almost all cases such counterfeits are of defective quality and do not meet minimum legal standards. Thus the counterfeit parts can become a danger for vehicle occupants or uninvolved third parties. The comparison of the braking distances took place under the same conditions at the same initial speed and the same braking point. The longer braking distance for the car with the counterfeit brake disks is the result of the defective quality that frequently occurs with counterfeit products."
if you don't have money to buy genuine just buy brembos
In my recommended? I don't have a car
"You should rather but a good alternative brand like Zimmermann, so you're sure that you don't get a counterfeit Mercedes part."
lol driver on black car forgot press to brake
"Wahhh, so fake test."
Original part overpriced. There are lots of non Mercedes brand that perform very well
"Mercedes-Benz orders TRW to produce Brake Discs and Brake Pads . You can see the logo of TRW in the video. Thus,I better buy OEM brake pads and brake discs from TRW. It is much cheaper and same quality."
it is fake
1:45 - why the brown car is so much faster..? LoL
genuine parts are tooooooooooooo expensive !
Counterfeit .... : (Aftermarket)
"This are low quality parts... but what about ""legal"" aftermarket parts ? (Bosch, Valeo etc)"
I am like many skeptikal of this test. It reminds a bit of when the police investigates the police. But I want to give MB credit for one thing - The comment section is still open. That's very honest to not just hush criticism.
i dont believe he applied the breaks as hard in the counterfeit break version.
1:53 you should not be talking
"What you claim could be true. But, you're Mercedes Benz selling a Mercedes Benz product over your competition. How do we know your demonstrations are not biased?"
"this is genuine bullshit. I'm a mechanic and i repair only mercedes. I can confirm this is bullshit. The actual difference is in wear and not in the braking distance. Tested by me. Same car new oem and new trw aftermarket. Both performed the exact same. The only difference is that the one who used trw changed the discs and pads two exact months before the oem ones. (both c klasse same year same month bought the same day). But considering the price difference (800$) i think two months is nothing. For the price of the oem brakes and pads you can come see me and get an oil change,filters,brakes and pads,coolant and you can buy with the rest of the money bulbs for the entire car and get a nice detailing at a pro shop and i still think you can get a really nice meal and a massage while the car gets done."
I replaced my pads and discs with EBC branded products.
loads of crap! any of brake pades sold in ue must meet some of standards to be solde in eu so pls don't make yourself bad looking

"Do not buy a Mercedes car brand! Very low reliability. I drove a car with just 50,000 km. I use my car very accurately and carefully. and the motor required expensive repairs to replace the chain, couplings, krushek, nyatyazhitelya. The alarm lamp - Check-Engine. I saw the malfunction of the P034062 engine. The sensor of provision of an inlet cam-shaft (the first number of cylinders) has electric malfunction. And this malfunction is massive after the expiration of the warranty period. All motors require engine repair up to 100,000 km. The manufacturer refuses to recognize the defect."

Not the world I want to live in. Thanks for showing your true intentions Mercedes. I'd rather ride my bike and let you win but stay true to my values. For example that every try matters and if you fail, try again. I get the point with your safety and original parts thing. But is this the message that sticks? Or is it the one you tell in every scene: Nice try but YOU are not enough."

"I currently own the 2017 CLS, I bought it right when I have a look of this so call New Gen Cls. Sure, New Gen Cls is beautiful, but no personality at all, and the worst, it ruins all the pass legacy of its class. Now I know who to blame, Mr. Gorden."
yes this is fine good looking car you are okay
UGLY
"Wow, what an ugly ugly rear. How did the entire design team agree on that? What was the most elegant sedan model is now your ugliest. It's been blunder after blunder after the S-class in 2013. Esp the coupes and their rears. Bar the S-class, MB cars don't look characteristically Mercedes anymore. And then there's that new AMG grill..."
I love wagner's design
It's shit
"Sorry, but this Design is way too round... the scetches look way more aggressiv, than the final car, so why don't you go a bit more extreme and not try to make all products look the same, like BMW or Audi.
I always loved Mercedes, just because of the variety from S- to A-class and I hope, that al least this will stay🙈"
The more you look at it the prettier it gets. I love the stance.
"The headlights and tail lamp are not proportional with the huge body of CLS. The last facelift is the best Mercedes design language, kind of timeless design. (IMHO)"
"Congrats, you killed another MB star! Before it was SL. The S class is still a bomb, other models are crap. It happens because you spend all your design ideas on side models. CLS, SL and S Class must be unique, the best or nothing!"
Заебись тачка!
Schmuckstück ❤
SO this is the guy who ruined the looks of the majestic CLS.
"Progressive interior you claim........bullshit, it's the same as the other models, what a load of bull!!"

U ruined it's unique look to be honest , rip old school cls :("
"It's awful, doesn't look like Merc at all!!! Hope you are going to fire the designers!"

Eres muy gracioso
The back of the car looks bad I prefer the previous one
wa oo this is fine good looking car is okay for VIP keep it up you are the best
"it looks like the new Opel Insignia, especially the front. That was my first impression, seriously"
"Too shame thinking that this is a future headlights design for each MB model. 
P.S. Here I draw the headlights like I see it... https://www.facebook.com/nightpinsk/posts/1514374768628354?pnref=story"
Ugly car
Those headlights look like jaguar's.

I like s class my daddy have b class and s class and sports car mercedes
You have a licinse
But if the speed is above the limit it wont slow the car down!
"Daimler, why don't you update Autopilot software in all your 2013, 2014, 2015 models? There should be a team of engineers who CONTINUE to work on updates for the past generations as well. For example. 2013 or 2015 e-class has stereo camera, radar , but... it does not slow down on traffic sign speed limits when driving in semi-autonomous mode. 20 seconds annoying hands-on-steering-wheel-warning (time limit length increased in 2016 e-class. I want the same!) 2016 e-class has this, but no one at MB cares about customers from 2015, 2014 and 2013. This is a big deal. There should be updates to Autopilot with each visit to the MB car service in dealership. You leave your car each year for a day or two for A or B service, the software for Autopilot is updated. It can't be like it is now, that 2015 E-class has OLD software, completely abandoned after it was sold. Autopilot from 2013-2015 has a lot of room for improvement. The car should turn on Autobahn way better and keep itself in the center of lane, not swing from left to right or even cross lane on sharper curves. The CEO of Daimler should see this and consider my comment. DO UPDATES, like TESLA. Do not abandon your customers. Make their driving better, more enjoyable and SAFER with each year they own their car. It cannot continue to be like SELL AND FORGET. I hoped each year the Autopilot will be updated. Nothing was updated. Nothing. The car behaves and has flavs like it had in 2015. This is very disappointing and turns my sight into Tesla direction. They update their maps for free, they update the autopilot the whole time. Daimler, are you a worse company? Don't your customers deserve the best service?"
Where is another video is series?
"Hmm, Why would he whiten his teeth ?"
When is the next episode coming out? I would love to see more features and longer videos!

Dude.  Seriously.  Why do you have to look at your passenger while driving.  Always keep your eyes forward.
"""Turn on your Blinker"" - großartig!"
"Distronic, been around since 1999, in the W220 S Class and yet Tesla have a more advance system"
Love seeing this in action - I have an in-depth review of the S-Coupe on our channel if anyone wants to check it out
Absurd. Completely.
"Hack? Moron, get a vocabulary."
"The concern I have with every distronic function whether from the BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes I’ve driven so far is that the car carries on driving up to the car ahead at its set cruise speed and then brakes to reach the set distance.This a very unconventional way of driving. It feels as if the car is going to plough through the traffic ahead but reacts atcthe last minute. Is this new system less aggressive than previous versions?"
"So, what do we have? Tesla Autopilot in basically more complicated and less useful. 
Terrific."
Tesla Autopilot 2 is better.
Nice

"I just picked up my fully loaded, Brand New,  E-Coupe and was told the remote parking assist via cell phone is NOT, repeat NOT available in the USA!!! So be careful when buying based on these videos."
and this is not available in US...lame..
yes you are the best keel it up
This thing is just a gimmick for unnecessary laziness. It would be more efficient if I park it by my own.
MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!!!!!!! all you need lookup the price for a S-Class lol :D

"Illegal in the UK at least,  leaving the vehicle while the engine is running is an offence in the UK, and quite probably in most EU countries, as the laws are mostly harmonized."
"It doesn't work in practice. I was foolish enough to buy it as an option on my new E class and it's utterly useless. You could spend an hour driving slowly around a car park before it would ""spot"" a suitable space, if you're fortunate enough that the sensors have picked out a sensible spot it parks very, very slowly, embarrassingly so. The remote function on the phone only works on a very limited set of handsets and there is zero support at Mercedes for any issues with the software ( my old galaxy S3 works but my new PixelXL is not compatible) . It's maybe fun to try once but in practical terms, useless."
"Oh i can just imagine how happy all the other drivers will be, queuing up behind and waiting impatiently in the multi storey car park while i get out and park my car with my phone.

Seriously Mercedes, get a grip on reality."
"Hi, mercedes, let us know when you reach the Tesla technology level, and maybe we will give a damm."
I wish the system was a little more sensitive in my 17 C63 AMG. I’ve only gotten to use it a handful of times and the perpendicular parking has never worked.
What's hidden under the white square 0:46 - 0:49 ?
A bit bored
Not available in the U.S

This is fantabulous. I can't believe it.  How I wish my channel will give me enough money to buy that car

"holy hell my fav four door was the ls 500, now the cls450 has topped it"
The one and only Mercedes that actually looked beautiful..was the CLS..and at last all the good job making the design of the mainstream model looking good worked out..but they fucKeD up the CLS..sigh..
No need to be that judge mental 😒😒
stupid ford mustang look

"The problem with every new Mercedes is exterior design especially with ugly lights like w213 and w205 . Mercedes doesn't look anymore like Mercedes . Old models w123 ,124,140.... was a piece of art and also w211 212 until they arrived to w213... we have also to look at the ugly steering wheel they made today."
I love Mercedes-Benz
Inspired by Ford Mustang
looks like a cheap knockoff of a ford mustang....reminds me of a cheap car thats all I know
I owned the 2006 CLS and it was the masterpiece during those years.. but mercedes totally ruins the CLS image with this 3rd generation.. extremely disappointed

The new CLS very ugly. Prefer last gen.
"Did you copy Audi with the Taillights ?

The DRL look like Nissan's 😣

It's ugly! The previous gen was one of the best looking cars out there. But the best 4 door coupe is the BMW M6 Gran Coupe! Hope they don't mess up the next CLS63

"Horrendous, doesn't have a premium styling. Front end looks like a sharper 2018 Mustang, Rear looks like a Kia Cadenza. Absolutely ruined the legacy if the CLS whose original design was breathtaking."

"Imagine this car was in fast and furious,and they have to do a dangerous maneuver to save the world or something.Then the car brakes halfway😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Tesla has it already doesn't it???????
"What if the red car has also such a system in place, and it detects the black car coming towards it. It will apply breaks in order to avoid the collision, and the black car will do the same. There would occur a ""sweet spot"" wherein the red car will apply break for just a little while and so will the black car. Seeing black car reducing its speed, red car will stop applying the break, causing it to accelerate again, and so will the black car for the same reason. Seeing the black car stopped decelerating, the red car will apply the break again and so on and so forth. Both the cars will start moving like a snail until they pass each other.  At this point, you can just play ""What is love"" and stay still, what you would have invariably created is the all so famous Jim Carrey move. (https://youtu.be/FFa-C7NeOsU?t=3s)"
I had such situations on the highway today and admits it is sensational. Good Job Mercedes!

"How to undestend, what kind of asist sistem have my gl166?

Today me and my dad were driving and there was an accident right in front of us. This legit saved us.
Didnt volvo come up with this like 10 years ago ?
i am driving   s 560  but   i  don't like  active break  system.  some  time   suddenly breaking   .    my boss  thinking  that is  my fault    after  he  shouting  me..
"Hi @Mercedes-Benz , I have a Class A w176 2017 Urban (EU) with Break asssitant, does it work like this too? Because it shows the icons, beeps but never stop like that. Of course I don't plan to hit a wall but seem to don't work"
Question: si there a speed range for auto break to work?
Is that system standard?
Why always not real obstacle in test? Maybe not sure for AEB working ok? (Volvo tested some time ago with real car and get not succes...)
I guess I'll buy it
"You have to start braking _early_ to signal to the driver behind you, otherwise you get rear-ended."
what happened if you overtaking other vehicle in suburban two lane road??
So cool!
What would happen if the red car were to pull into the front of the Mercedes....but then BRAKE (in panic) while the Mercedes intends to travel behind?? Would the Mercedes react to the new situation of the car still being in front of it ??
A little bit behind Tesla...

"Germans who became Americans are the reason Detroit became the motor city. Great engineers, but I don't believe Germans can or should be trusted with the fate of the Enlightenment. Brexit was good and the rest of Europe should follow suit. 

Personally I'm not a Slav but recommend the Russians and other Block countries to look to in manner and course."

BMW FTW !!!
"awesome!! I wish I could work for Mercedes-Benz!! It's my favourite car manufacturer! This is my reaction to when americans compare their cars to the luxury, safe Mercedes style : give up, americans, Mercedes-Benz never has and never will come to the point of releasing a ford pinto, knowing that if a crash happens, it could kill up to 8 people because of a fuel tank exploding.  Another thing Mercedes-Benz won't do is this: WORK OUT WHETHER FIXING THE PROBLEM OR DEALING WITH THE LAWSUITS WOULD BE CHEAPER, THEN DECIDE TO LET PEOPLE DIE AND PAY FOR IT! SO GIVE UP AMERICANS. MERCEDES HAS NEVER DONE SOMETHING AS GREEDY AND AS SELFISH AS THAT AND THEY NEVER WILL."
"oh, hi Philip!"
"Dudes, Mercedes people and Derek....Please actually demonstrate the equipment?!? Nobody can tell that the seat sat upright, or the window closed, or the belts tightened or ANYTHING because you didn't use a rigidly-mounted camera, but some doofus with a NIKON....Use a mount! then we can see the seat moving relative to the vehicle."

Hey Mercedes, while you're at it, why don't you develop an automatic blinker system. 
No Mercedes in my country ever blinks when turning or changing lanes.

I'd like to know if this presafe stuff has been tested on dummies and has shown results
The pre-safe sound... that’s how a rattlesnake sound.
There are situations when people survive a huge crash only because of being thrown out of the car. Aren't these systems killing you then?

"Do not buy a Mercedes car brand! Very low reliability. I drove a car with just 50,000 km. I use my car very accurately and carefully. and the motor required expensive repairs to replace the chain, couplings, krushek, nyatyazhitelya. The alarm lamp - Check-Engine. I saw the malfunction of the P034062 engine. The sensor of provision of an inlet cam-shaft (the first number of cylinders) has electric malfunction. And this malfunction is massive after the expiration of the warranty period. All motors require engine repair up to 100,000 km. The manufacturer refuses to recognize the defect."

"if you record a video in germany but mirror it, the audience may think it was england or australia"
"You are the living legend that is unlike you. So far, God is without emotion, Mercedes is the first in everything, or everything is collected. Something from the Rolls Royce aristocracy, something from the Toyota trade, something from Italian sport, something from the safety of Volvo and some rough roads. From the hour of the Americans and the king of the sedans and the beauty of beauty and fair even in the engines are not Hilk Balzrf or BMW everything ..v6 !!! And we will not forget the future is coming with supercar hybrids and sedan the two super sedans are concept gt the start is better than gtr ... !!! This is Mercedes"

maybe new one will be batter then old one, but this new G will never get Legendary status among off road vehicles like old one...."

However the Mercedes dealer got a parking ticket the day of the sale, before I bought the car, and are not paying it. Can you please take care of this Mercedes?

"This X-Class is a huge missed opportunity in my mind. If Mercedes had designed it all in house, as well as worked with MB cars as well as MB vans, the X class would be a much better vehicle. When Mercedes put's their minds to something, the result is usually excellent, for example the G-Wagon and S-Class. In addition, marketing it as a passenger car more and giving it a class, like the GLX perhaps, would have made it much more appealing. Finally, if this car was sold in the US, it would achieve excellent success."

"Trust me, Mercedes, you'd love to come to Kenya and teach your cars how to avoid and mitigate effects of severe potholes, how to recognize hand gestures from traffic police (since many of our traffic lights don't work), and how to deal with unruly bus drivers. No other manufacturer will do that. That will definitely put you at least 3 years ahead."
"AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety just published the results of a study 
on the impact of modern multimedia systems and the risks they pose to 
driving safety.   The most dangerous, they said is the handling of 
the navigation system and, in particular, entering the address. It 
requires maximum concentration, distracts the driver from the traffic 
situation and creates the greatest risks of accidents.

electric power for only 25km is kinda underwhelming
"Amazing! I love how its design looks intelligent. A design made by people with long experience. Most of modern hyper cars try to put as much elements as they can. But this design looks modern and clean at the same time. And it resembles other models of Mercedes, so I can tell it is a Mercedes even without the emblem."
My dream is for BMW to make one of these. BMW join F1 and beat their ass and make a Hypercar we know you can do this .... ///M gods lets prey!!
This the best future of Mercedes Benz
"Only 25 km on electric power alone. HA! That's child's play. I have already designed a vehicle that I reckon could do several thousand km and on top of that, its thermal efficiency is pushing the 70% mark."

Perfect car. Much better than the EQC because less disadvantages. Great. You are on the right way. Build it in more numbers!
I have a new dream car. Now all I have to do is win the lottery.
"Finally, no more of this stop gap hybrid Electric Petrol/Diesel nonsense, but an end goal product. The benefits of hydrogen fuel cells are huge."
Super schönes Auto und klasse Konzept! Meine nächste H2 Tankstelle ist nur 10km vom Wohnort weg. Bin sehr interessiert an diesem Auto. Wann gibts mehr Infos?
I hope there won't be separate motors for batteries and for fuel cell but that the they power the same motor. If so I am buying this the moment it comes in a coupe/sportier variant.
Fuel cells are the future.
"That's great, now show me where is the nearest hydrogen station."
I admit F-cells are better solution then batteries... but no engine sound and no manual gearbox - where the emotions went? And you call that clinical transportation from A to B future? No thanks! I'm going strait to a nice young-timer for many many enjoyable miles!
"Nice! I have always said that fuel cell technology is the future rather than 100% battery power. I belive the environmental/human cost of digging up the minerals and recycling of batteries are far greater than we can see today.

I only wonder if hydrogen fuel cell may be a problem in cold countries or does the cars have a tank to catch the water? Imagine in 15 years with 40% of the cars spitting out water on the frozen roads!"
that has a big potential! keep going mercedes benz f-cell technologie is the futur!
hydrogen fuel??? is this serious?
I love the car is better
She's beatiful
"Waiting forward to the future, awesome concept"

thats futur!
"I LOVE the upgrades to the infotainment screen, the digital dials, starter button and bumper."
So Glad yall are going hydrogen! It will take both EVs and Hydrogen to propel the world in a new direction.
Is this how the 2018 GLC will look like
"Gr8 , when H2 stations is build here in sweden i will buy one of these.  Would look nice next to my Ferrari. ;)  If MB had built H2 stations instead of throwing billions in next gen dieselengine, they could already have had the infrastructure in place... why not begin with adding sunroof on all your buildings,  producing electricity, heat and H2 for overproduction. If you build electrolyzers you can sell heat to citys district heating grids or large buildings + H2"

my dad has mercedes benz E350e plugin hybride c:
Hoffentlich schaut Mercedes nochmal Tesla über die Schulter. Für 30km lohnt es sich nichtmal einen Elektromotor einzubauen.
only 30km/ isnt really much at least 50 km is much better choice
Интересно сколько гарантия на батареи?
"MercedesMe App, wird diese App eines Tages einwandfrei funktionieren??"
"Mercedes E 350e is a beaty and eletric great car, bit the problemi is the power (286 cv) and the cost (€ 62.947)"
Love the rims.
Electric motor 30 km? 😂😂 stupid
"Beautiful car, but still only hybrid."
Amazing tech...when will the more powerful versions of the coupe be released and when will the convertible be released in the United States?
"30  km is a joke.
I miss the old undestroyable mercedes engines . We need simple and amazing reliabel cars , without stupid electronics.
like w124 and w210 . lpg engines would be cool too.."
those rims are...         something you needs getting used to.
Can it be charged back to 100% just from driving ?

My firend is a really bug Mercedes fan
"It's mostly plastic. And think about the repair cost if something goes really wrong. In the end all these gadgets break. 
Air suspension, climate control, fans, displays...and a hundred things more.
And after 10 years every car has lost its value anyway. 
Spend the money on something that is here to stay, like a house."
"Aburrido, esa camioneta es la misma que hace 5 años. Le quieren sacar jugo un año mas, que chafa marca."
Really cool
This is glorious
"Best car and technologie car ever. Daimler invented the car, again"
Miraj killer?
"I might not like the electric future - but can agree that F-cells are the right EV choice! 
Electric cars with batteries as just a silly try and real scam regarding ecological benefits."
My only concern is after crash results ..
MERC THE BEST !!!!!!
"Stop showing white people moving here and there others pretending to be working on a computer when really nothing is happening in Mercedes Benz, creativity is dead there, you are building nothing this days"
It feels like you are trying to sit with one ass on two chairs. What is future for cars? Hydrogen or all electric? Concentrate on one thing and make the best there is.

Let's be realistic no one gave a toss about the smart.
27:50 Anyone else get that #TRON vibe in the music as I did. Still one of my favorite throw-back movie universes.
WoW HONDA NSX is better than that garbage Mercedes amg Project One.
"its... ugly, really."
"I wonder if Lewis likes this Project One better than his Pagani 760LH? Because as of right now without seeing the Project One on a track being tested/reviewed i would happily take Lewis's Pagani as i just think it is a absolutely stunning road car, it's just beautiful..the purple colour just suits it so well imo, it's a stunning looking car from what little footage there is of LH driving it. But i am ready to be blown away by AMG's Project One and can't wait to see it being tested."
Looks like a modified Mc F1
"TRON OST, still dope after all these years."
Absolutely stunning and looks ready to tear up some tracks

"Ein echtes musical wäre besser gewesen als diese so darzustellen. Der Wagen sieht gar nicht mal so schlecht aus. Wenn die mal diese Mittelklasse usw. weg lassen, wird es vielleicht für alle etwas. Es liegt immer noch an den preisen."
The best of all Mercedes Benz *Forever*
Looks like something batman would drive!!!
The roof ruins the whole car. Always use full metal roofs on 150000£ cars
The real ultimate driving machine
Im more of a BMW fan but I got to say this car looks better than any other BMW coupe 👍
THIS IS MY DREAM CAR
AMG front grille is ugly. Hope they make it only as an option
i love the mercedes tecnology
Great job Mercedes-Benz
Nice exterior ugly ass interior in my opinion
"Dear CEO of Mercedes Benz
I hope you're doing well : )

Kindly send one of these gorgeous angles to my house. I prefer the White color with red interior. Please don't forget to write to me a gift card which I want it to has Mercedes logo on the back of it with my name above it ; )

Reach to me to get my address.

Best regards,"
"The ""Panamericana"" front grill is just awful design decision! 
It look cool on GT but here is stupid! Damn, stop copying design elements from model to model!!! Stop that lazy copy paste design!!!"
I dont like the new grille on the AMG. It looks like a Buick.
So cool
Words are useless.
!!!!!!
The best or nothing
love thiss car 😍
That redesigned front for the AMG- spec is just too sexy.
My car❤
I am ready for EQ!
"i have some questions about the app , can you use this app with a diesel or petrol engine car or it has to be electric or hybrid only? Another question can i track my car while iam driving or i have to complete my distance and then see what the app recorded from the phone?"

"Dear Mercedes Benz, can you please make the next e class have the classic Benz grill? like the s class has.  Back in the 90's e class vehicles had the same grill done differently for the e class.  

Used to have a 94' E500 that was assembled by porsche.  It had beautiful flared wheel arches, that was tastefully done.

I guess I am asking for updated version of the 94' e class AMG."

What do you mean by DRIFT MODE??? You mean turning ESP off??
Amg Mercedes n 1😎
lol it has misdemeanor mode X)
M5 2017 (F90) is the best . It is the   killer of E63 amg + hhh
Rather have a Tesla Model 3 ⚡⚡
"Another stupid add! Sending message ""Focus your energy"" for a car which is trying to split it personality at least to sport driving and luxury (I could easily add practicality so there is 3 personalities already) is damn stupid! Which of this 3 should E63 focus?!"
"Looks like promotion of dangerous driving by Mercedes. Really, a stupid ad."
Finally a Mercedes we can drift.
0:50 I think this car is about to run a red light.
"Wait when you activated drift mode, doesn't it say use only for track?"

"Guys from AMG and Mercedes Benz! After watching so many reviews it looks like you acomplish to create a M5 finally. For the last years all reviews pointed out how wild was every M5 that was released. For the last days, some reviews choose the Bmw because of its practicality when before they would always choose every M5 for it's radical conception. Finally elegance and wildness it's been combined to a such level that excuses become useless. So happy that Mercedes Benz is risking and creating the best cars in the world. Do you remember some years ago, in Spain when all ad's would tell to the audience: ""Something it's happening inside Mercedes Benz"". Now we got it!! So proud of you guys!! A Merc it's always been a goal for so many atributes. My papa always told me!!"
Force lourd♥👍
"Well, negotiate that kind of driving style and speed with the cities and government authorities for AMG models and everyone going to buy one ;)"

"Cheap plastics, looks like the Nivara side on and has a Nissan keyfob and its not even made in Germany, and you want almost $70,000 for a base model with a piddly underpowered Renault engine, I love my Benz but I'm not that gullible, when all this parts bin cars issues have been revealed and you update and fix it in 3 years in typical Benz fashion then I'll look again 4/10."
Thats how I feed my eel
I Always wanted a Note expensive navara
What happened to the concept car
Navara facelift looks great!
Nissan with Make up haha. Very disappointing MERC.
COMING SOON......
Ho needs this
So epic!
looks similar to that Honda Truck in my opinion
What's the song?
For the rich working class
This truck will not sell it is going to be unreliable and it's pretty ugly the only thing good about it is it's interior
Nissan Navara in disguise. There is some stiff competition waiting for it in South Africa!
"The concept looked so much better, inside and out, but I am slowly warming up to this car. And after watching this nice clip I think I can understand the target market of this vehicle better and why they would be interested in purchasing one. Nice work!"
"I personally liked the concept truck better. Either way, I'm still an MB fan and owner of 2 of them. The best or nothing...."
"Will this be available in North America? Also, X63?????? 😊"
Nice Navara.
X63/X65 incoming! =)))

That 300 is beautiful. I would seriously like to ride shotgun in that car while it tears around the Nurburgring or Spa.

That car already exists. It is called taxi.
"Like Klaus Schneider said
It's better to don't focus 100% on elektric cars which have a range of max. 250 km.
The old cars from Mercedes you could drive 1mio. Km
Some people like to drive Mercedes cause the engine.
The Engine is so good than it can be the only reason to buy  a Mercedes Benz."
"Why mercedes isnt focusing on reliablel and and undestroyable cars anymore ? I miss the good old w124 series , which you can drive for 1 million km without problems. No one needs electric cars with a range of 50-200 km and no one needs autonomus driving , we all made a driver license !"
If that is the future I'll stick to the golden heritage!

"Pongo en conocimiento y en alerta a aquellas personas que adquirieron recientemente o están pensando en la compra de un automóvil de la marca Mercedes Benz, que tienen que conocer lo que a un usuario de la marca le sucede:
En el mes de mayo del año 2013, adquiri un automóvil de la marca Mercedes Benz, modelo A 200, blue efficiency, al mismo se le realizaron todos los servicios de mantenimiento que indica el manual en talleres oficiales, el ultimo en el taller de Klasse en Avda del Libertador en Vte. Lopez.
En el mes de julio del corriente año y con 38.000 kms. De uso el auto comenzó a tener una falla en el motor, acudi al concesionario de referencia y allí me indicaron que el problema se debía a que había que reemplazar las bujías, me parecio raro que con tan pocos Km. Tuviera que hacer esa reparación pero finalmente accedi a realizarla, habiendo abonado el costo de la reparación, retire mi vehiculo y a poco de andar compruebo que la falla sigue estando.
Me comunico con el concesionario donde se efectuara la reparación y me dicen que lo lleve, dejo nuevamente mi vehiculo y al cabo de una semana me informan que el problema son los inyectores y que debo reemplazar los mismos con un costo de reparación exorbitante, ante mi planteo del poco Km. Que tiene el vehiculo, la respuesta del concesionario y de MB Argentina fue que las partes dañadas son elementos de desgaste y que es NORMAL que esto suceda, desconociendo cualquier tipo de responsabilidad.
La pregunta que hago es, porque MB tiene valores de venta de sus productos de alta gama y ofrece un servicio de cuarta y elude cualquier responsabilidad."

Mercedes is the best car in the World.

"The latest concepts #AMG GT and #Maybach 6 are stunning and elegant pieces of art.
But I still can not get my head arround the EQ fronts or most electric cars. Guess I still prefere having a real grill even on an all electric vehicle. Maybe it is because I still associate an air intaking front with a performance car and a closed off front with a toy ..."
EQ-class interior 80%     exterior 30%
"Why buy Mercedes? You've actually tried money bonfires and still can't get rid of it fast enough! It's either a Benz or a pipeline from your bank account straight to the gates of hell. It doesn't matter how rich you are, the expense is the same and for all that money you get a lot of empty hype. For instance the SLS is not worth four corvettes but that's what it costs. Certified Benz technician means guy with Benz-specific $5'000 tool set. It's the same with most European cars. Literature for these cars that isn't in German is also limited or non-existent. For all that ""Over engineering"" every European car is crawling with gremlins. It doesn't take long for them to show up and cause trouble with a capitol $."
Beautiful
Mercedes-Benz i got a feedback i just want to tell you that about most of the mercedes cars that comes with the piano black trim in the center console it looks nice but it scratch easily.

"In serial production you will ruin design as always, esspecialy the interior...Mercedes should not be a fancy car!"

I think this is pretty shameful for Mercedes-Benz. Cars are on the verge of handling all the different conditions on public streets and Benz can't even drive in a parking house without complex additional sensors installed.
Great success!

"For those who were wondering about the song:this is what I found out. This song is composed by a music company named 'yessian music' who makes songs for commercials. So it's not a song that's been released before. No wonder nobody found out the title! I've attatched the link for those who are interested :)

No tienen idea de lo que el trabajo en el campo y el off road
This is going to sell hard and fast. It has that look to it. Sell your expensive HiLux now and buy into something nice.
"so, what will the X45 AMG Be like?"
"I don’t know, it doesn’t look mean enough for Mercedes-Benz, it should have bolder front and bigger taillights, right now it doesn’t look any special, there are better looking pickup trucks out there! Even Crappy Ford looks like a beast! Well its only first gen, in the future it should look bolder and meaner!"
Ugly and probably way to expensive
The presenter is the God of cringe! Well done Mercedes :-/
"Are you serious? That is ,- nothing?"
Doesn't take 60 seconds to say it's just a rebadged Nissan that isn't good enough to compete in America against real trucks
Hope that's the version meant for the African-market too
What? It's not a X class((((
How come AMG doesn't have their hands on this already??? or do they............... and this better come to the U.S.
Awful awful video. No words to describe it. There are so many ways this could have been done better for MB's first pickup
Mercedes needs to fire to the two stoned teenagers that pick paint colors for them.
This truck won't stand a chance in North America.
"Why would you send this to such strange markets when Mercedes has such strict maintenance requirements. I also get that the pickup truck market in north america is already bloated with competition, but I think it could see success if it fills a niche."

Now my dealer is offering me a new motor for 7.000€ + labour cost.

Could you please explain what was my fault? 
What was my mistake? 
Why I need to pay half price of my car for a motor?"

Earlier: why g-wagon does not pass the crash test? - here's a response in the form of punched walls)) And Parking for those who need it? Or we did 20 special colors for those who need it, however dirty the g-wagon looks the same))) I would call it troling from giant who can afford it and it was awesome!"
But I like Land Rover Defender. It is super. Geländewagen is good too🖒

I adore Amy's perspective. Great photographer.
"Fantastic! We've just been working with Amy Shore on a Lightweight Jaguar E-type film - see it on our channel. We'd love to shoot a classic Mercedes for you, what about a 450SEL like the one in Classic Mercedes Magazine this month?"
Thank you for keeping Alex's family safe!! Thank you Mercedes!! Keep making safer cars!!!❤❤❤❤❤
"At 2.11  “I truly believe a car isn’t alive until there is a person in it”
Couldn’t agree more Amy, I believe every car has a soul.  Call me crazy but each time I visit a car museum I feel that if we could hear the car speak it would be screaming something like, 
GET ME OUT OF HERE AND TAKE ME FOR A DRIVE!!!"

"nice, but I think it is over cut.. never really got into conversation between them, just heard the answers"
"First off I am a proud Mercedes-Benz owner. But after seeing this video, I think that is a ugly percentage and that it is way too high. Why would anyone let their spouse or significant other determine or ""influence""what kind of car they should drive? Everyone Man and Woman should drive what they love and what makes them happy especially if it's a Mercedes-Benz. I am just happy that I'm apart of the 20% vs the 80%, I drive what I love and love what I drive."
I dreamed of owning this car but I did not have enough money to buy it.

"I just love Mercedes Benz, while google created autonomous cars, they basically got modern day cars and attached a ugly spinning thing on top, meanwhile Mercedes waits until the future (well you guys made them already) for autonomous cars without those ugly spinning things and with lots of technology and a million times better design.

I wish you can come to Alaska and try one of your future autonomous cars here (Well I guess it's a bad idea cause people in here are not good drivers and will destroy your precious car.) But it'll be cool."

People it is only conpect version of the car
It look good
So the cla is gone now?
Not that i don't like the car but why is Mercedes leaving behind their great iconic styling ?!
"WTF? Новая решетка по мотивам вольво? Серьезно? Не будет горизонтальных полос, имеющихся в каждом мерсе с рождения марки? Мда. Корма практически не изменилась по сравнению с CLA. А ещё наверняка будет стоить дороже, чем нынешнее поколение. Сами с собой опять конкурируют. С класс и А класс и так уже сравнялись совсем...."

I was a fan of your products until this came up"
Mercedes relating it to Israel? Ok that's not a problem..but why on an illegal land? Mercedes should review its decision..million people's view on the brand will surely fall..their image will be lost if they know this thing..
"That's the most stupid thing I've ever seen of Mercedes. I was always proud to own & drive Mercedes cars just because how they make them & how much they're smart to market them. but after this silly & stupid video I changed my mind about Mercedes. It's called PALESTINE, not israel. & israel is just an occupation regime which came from the rubbish of  Russia, Eastern Europe, Morocco & Africa. israel is the criminal regime which killed thousands of civilians. All who spoke in the video are liars. A BIG DISLIKE SHAME TO MERCEDES. 🖕🖕🖕🖕"

Not sure about this. The CLA is the Sedan/Coupe of the A-class including the shooting brake. Even though this will probably mainly being sold for US and Chinese market.

Looks like lexus. I prefer actual design than this.
Good job doyoung
Perfect!

"Always the best unlike any automotive company. 
Mercedes - Benz is the best"
Tail lights looks like Audi's A3 Sedans
awesome!!
As always Mercedes Benz wins my heart.
"1st - There is too much CLA genes behind it and I don't think as a ""sedan"" this is good one. As MB fan I'll take Audi A3 sedan at a heartbeat. 
2nd - Stop using the ""Panamericana grill"" everywhere! Yes it is cool but keep it for the special editions damned! Not everywhere! 
... and speaking for ""using it everywhere"" stop put AMG badges to everything! The 43 models are not AMG call them sport or race or whatever you want but don't dilute the AMG! Don't flood the market with AMG something!"
OK see but my system same problem OK good I allowed you?  but save my all plz? 👀👀👀👀

I'm way too excited!!!!! Been waiting for this for a long time!

Fcuk u Mercedes U destroyed The M156 Engine....
Autovlog a YouTube channel purchased a c63 he stated that a truck splashed his C63 with water and it hydrolocked the Motor and it's due to the design of the intake. A new motor cost $71000. He's barely had the car 8 weeks. That sounds really strange. I've never heard of a Mercedes hydrolocking over some water getting splashed on it. And the the amount of time and money these cars through torture test it doesn't seem feasible that this car is getting totaled out.

The grading of the colors to peach and blue / grey looks a bit strange at first but I think it ties this video good to the Daimler brand.

The Best or the best...
Mercedes Benz should show some detail in it's performance. How they test and to show it's variety of the great everyday car to it's super cars.
The ABS and Air bags were created by Mercedes???
Mercedes is the best
There truly is nothing out there like a Mercedes-Benz.
"It's hard to choose between Mercedes and Volvo, they are both really safe, great build quality, strong, luxurious."
I Mercedes for life

"It is really cool he takes part in the adverts.
But if the future of mobility is Connectivity, Autonomous driving, Sharing and Electrification... then please keep that shit for you!!! 
Even today I'm pretty pissed off. Opening a car magazine instead for driving performance, engine and suspension development etc some fucking idiot spent 1000 words to describe the damn infotainment system - If I wanted that I'll buy a tech magazine!!! If I wanted connectivity I'll buy smartphone!!! if I wanted sharing and autonomous driving I'll take the bus!!! 
DAMN!!! PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS!!!
... just like Einstein forecast over half a century ago :("
I would have been great if mercedes me was working for cars from 2012 onwards because they are already connected. Plus you can get more data from the user for future mercedes developments mercedes connected cars come on!!!

where is mercedes amg e63 s coupe??? are they not coming??
AMG GT concept sound tiger ♥
"So...is this what looks to be like an AMG GT, but crossover?"
"Mercedes-Benz  Hi, can you suggest to German mercedes manufactures to also include this AMG GT model as 1600cc /1.6litres 4 doors cars for popular countries such as Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, south africa and others?? 

Everything are the same accept the engine are 1.6Litres to be more better & far ahead than Audi s4 turbo,bmw 4 series turbo & mercedes c class turbo, mercedes coupe below 1.6litres as their current problems are

- lack of technologies ( such as rear seat electric adjusment &memories, reverse camera, front camera, sunroof/moonroof/Panoramic roof, safety censors, navigations etc.. )

- rear air- con, 

- rear seat spaces for 1.83 tall passengers too small for them seating at the back,

- the cars power picking up speed (short & long distance speed)

- silence engine hybrid / 2 in 1 petrol&hybrid engines

Also pass me the direct email for such suggestions."

Looks like Panamera to me.
I don't like front headlights.
"OMG!

I Love this Car 😍"
I love how Mercedes have an intimidating sculpted look with striking lines like a stone sculpture....and beautifull smooth curves at the same time. very nice
"Сейчас бы у Тесла дизайн воровать, ммм"

This car is beautiful! I am really impressed by car designs from Mercedes.

"Fun fact: Mercedes-Benz W210 called  ""Väyrynen"" in Finland. And Mercedes W201 called ""Pikkumersu"" in Finland."
"just because of YUNA, im here :)"
am i the only one who watched this expecting a female James bond? XD
"I've watched this 20 times, great job ladies!"
beautiful spot
Loveeeeeee this short video inspired commercial!
YUNAAA🔥🔥💯❤
"jet black mercedes, built in the 70's classic like you and me.

i guess this the reason mercedes chose yuna ha? huhu"
"yes, that was a good one, M-B ad crew..very effective and beautiful photography, too..and I learned about YUNA only just last year (here on YouTube, an interview and then I watched a few of her music videos)..and I recognized her right away. she's a very gifted person - good choice for a representative."
Yuna looks and sounds amazing....!!!
son los mejores coches del mundo
Amo los mercedes y los Bmw
I love
"I came here for Yuna and yeah, I love it 😍"
this is why I love Mercedes. missing my 88 W126
"Thank you Mercedes. I will now put down the crack pipe and flush my bag of marijuana down the toilet. I'm inspired and yes, I will grow up now, so that maybe in 30 years, my credit will be good enough to buy one of your vehicles. Then and only then I will know I've Grown Up. Now let me snort this last line of coke before I move on with my life...."
Just had a recent break up and I can relate to it so much. I have never felt this terrible before in my whole life. I watched it several times and I am just crying every time. But now I will stop. It is time to move on with my life and to fucking grow up!
"So many people complaining ""I don't get it"". Well I wouldn't say I get it, but it did remind me of those time spent sitting alone behind the wheel, reminiscing, feeling depressed and didn't know what to do with my life. Mercedes is trying to teach us - specifically, well-provided yet naive Millennials - a life lesson, and I do like what they are trying to do here: they are not selling the car itself. They blend the car into background, just like everything nice in your life that you *failed* *to* *recognize*"
Master Piece!
He should be very happy he got the bitch out of his life and managed to keep the Mercedes
Insult your largest demographic. Please tell me more how I need to grow up so I can walk off the Mercedes-Benz dealer ship and do business with some one else who respects me.
This is life is a video that chances my life 👍👍👍👍
"More like ""Give up""
Im pretty fine if that's what they meant it to be."
"It's about being forced to change and rethink  what we once thought was something great.  The man in the video as well as the brand, Mercedes, being forced to change and making the decision to then do it.   Cinematography is beautiful."
"So blue,So depression.the director should self-examination.but I support your videos.Wish more videos series."
Thats John Wick lol
"This could be genius or crap, the thing is people don't get it so it is a fail."
A very good advertisement that finally changes and that is different from all other car advertising. This one goes further and speaks to all.Very beautiful pictures! BravoWho are the actors in it?
"I feel like they sat down and went ""Okay how do we appeal to Millennials"" And each one of these shorts comes off in that exact way. I don't see it as a story, I see #AD #AD #AD. And I don't feel anything."
is this a joke?
"it was brilliant, it was touching, a good commercial."
Brilliant advertisement from Mercedes. This is also a motivational video. Love your life and keep going.
"BMW is for me the best car brand but damn, your Grow up commericals are so goood!"
Terrible campaign
"Même si tu penses à Alexa, porte ton casque. Tu vas grandir. Tu vas conduire."
"Seems like Mercedes doesn't know what does it mean to grow up. Arguing and starting scandals is not growing up it's more of a part of life. Maybe you should have made this add more oriented on the child, for example, that they've stopped arguing after finally realizing that now they have a responsibility and all that happened before seems meaningless and petty in view of that responsibility."
..... what?
‘Time to grow up’ isn’t that like saying it’s time to have a boring car?
"Hmmm... I'm all for growing up and starting a family, but this ad makes it seem like people can be sluts and degenerates in their youth and still ""settle down"" and build a family later on, which isn't really likely. No quality guy is gonna wife a hoe and build a family with her."
"I quite like theme of family that this video had, it makes it more relateable instead of just a car driving through the desert. Hope to see more like this in the future!"
really like this video !
"Great family orientated message, so rare these days!"
great actors
Music at 1:33 ? cheers
"So people drive gla are irresponsible, childish and having a fucked up sex life?"
"I bloody hate this advert. 

What if you don't want to ""settle down"" (get married and have kids). 

What if you're happy with just you And your girlfriend? 

You can grow up still, but having a family doesnt mean you've grown up.. 

Why not just get the car without a family? 

Every time I see it, it boils my blood. Because I just don't agree with it. 

Its a decent car, but it comes with the wrong message."
"""The best or nothing""Turn to ""Humen"" I thought I watching Volvo Ads."
"As a result of seeing this annoying advert, I will never buy a Mercedes. Sorry!"
Great Bildsprache & Story !
I swear I heard Cersei Lannister voice over the shorter version of this Ad
Bloody hell Mercedes-Benz. This is one of the best ads I've ever seen. Keep it real
no compro mais carro mercedes
"Dear Mercedes, 
What the hell is this steaming pile of crap?
You are a company who makes cars. Who the hell are you to dictate how grown up anyone should be? The word patronising doesn't even cut it. What were you thinking!?"
I like it to be honest
Mercedes needs to concentrate on making energy efficient cars and stop offering advice on how to destroy the planet.
👏🏻👏🏻
"The films from this campaign are so authentic and touching, I enjoy them very much. Keep up the good work, Mercedes!"
Fantastic production quality and nice emotional delivery of the message. Forgot this was a advertisement and not a short film. Bravo Mercedes!
"This should be shown to all parents. We know that they are worrying about us and they want us to live stable life, but for us that's boring. We should do what we want. We're all not the same person. We all have different kinds of talents and happiness."
Isnt he like retirement age anyways?
This one was awesome
ok. but how an unemployed man can afford this kind of a car?))  only man with a 'real job'
힝 ㅠㅠ 처음엔 아빠 치매인가 했는데 회사에서 잘렸구나 ㅠㅠ

"Boom! #Tears
#NowIWantAMercedes"
Really good one
It's quite match with Asian culture . I'd love this.
Series #GROWUP is super and crazy. Emotion emotion emotion. As a car Mercedes. Thanks.
This is not a commercial. It's like the next level of branded content filmmaking. So good.
"Ok, now this was a good one, bravo!"
DID SOMETHING HE DIDNT LIKE FOR 35 YEARS CUZ A BITCH. BOYS WE GOTTA STOP LETTING THESE BITCHES DICTATE HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES.
I bought a new a Mercedes-Benz sedan... and still don't know the song
song @ 1:04  >? ????????????????????????????
"Song please, the song ... Mercedes, help us a bit ..."
"the Police had a campaign (road safety) drop five (kilometers and hour) save lives (in the wet it probably should be ""drop ten see you again my friend"")) and the mercedes benz is driving faster I pull over and let them in front of me and then when I see the car that was behind with their high beam lights on during the day I understand why the benz was driving not four kilometers under the speed limit because if the driver behind them has on their high beams during the day they are probably under the influence of alcohol or maybe even drugs then I pull out in front of the car with their high beams on so the mercedes benz can drive more safely I have had the privilege of doing a lot of skateboarding and are most probably younger than the benz driver which means if the car behind hits me it is most likely that I can control the situation better than if the car with their high beams on had of hit the Mercedes Benz and in any case the drivers of the big five should be given preference (so when I'm driving and one of these cars comes up behind I take a side street to let them drive the limit probably they were four under but the poor quality components in the car I drive don't read true) because they paid and pay far more tax far far more tax than I ever did which means literally they have the right to be in front because they own a larger portion of the road the sad fact is these are the poorest in our society they give up anonymity and more importantly time they can spend with their family so they can serve others, in this country the people in the highest tax bracket one hundred and eighty thousand dollars of more which represents about four hundred thousand people meaning three percent of the population, pay, thirty that's right 30% of the taxes lots of love continual safe perfect successes respectfully yours adonaitsidkenu:):):)"
"I don't believe as a no one who thinks very highly of mercedes Benz that the Lady in the ad would by the look of her, drink a carbonated sugar laden soda. It is! very good, mercedeS bEnz chose someone who looks like they care about their health to help promote the company, it portrays the company as a company that cares about things that have meaning which I believe means more repeat business. On the business of the soda it takes away from the company in terms of it being a definate blemish on the big five audi, bmw, lexus, volvo and mercedes Benz in that they would portray those that have the privilige of driving Mercedes Benz' as being people who would partake in the consumption of such a beverage the fact is that sucrose (sugar) makes a persons' veins thinner by scraping away on the inside of the veins literally cutting them to pieces as I drive a far more expensive car costing a lot less dollars meaning the people that drive these cars are pretty well much to a man caring people they care about others say as a business man they give others employment so they can eat and feed their family and they practice medicine so that sick people can feel better again these are the same people who are the major donors when it comes to giving money to charity for the childrens hospital why the Mercedes benz is so much more valuable because it says that I am one of these type of people someone who cares when I see a Mercedes bEnz behind me (I drive four kilometers under the speed limit so if I'm going down a hill I have time to put on the brakes before I start to speed and if I start to ascend up a hill I have a little time to accelerate so as not to hold up traffic"
The only problem I see here is that you shouldn't drive a car in such an emotional state :P
Amazing story Mercedes. good job. nice modern brand image. the right story for the upcoming generation. I really love it! go on!
Credits?
just like  'san junipero' by  black mirror
"The background make me think it was set in California, so does this mean the A-Class is coming to the US market?"
Looks like a social ad. All clip I've been expecting they'd smash into something.
THAT WHAT THAT GUY GETS FOR CHASING A BITCH
Your adverbs are so complicated Mercedes.
What's that song?
"Beautifully shot and very emotional! What felt a bit off was the line „Our friendship will last forever“, seriously? Was this supposed to be ironic? The whole story looks like they are in a relationship and Natasha abruptly broke off contact with her girlfriend, not her friend…"
nice
I am a big Mercedes fan
Why didn’t they show us the interiors the insides
Nice red paint job and we should be called the mercedes amg gt x when mercedes decided to put this in production
Top👌👍💪
I'm literally looking at it now ! What a beast !!!

I don't understand why they are making the gt into a four door it's going to ruin the car it is 1000000% better as a 2 door super/sports car
Breathtaking!

This would be better a car if it was fully Electric to compete with the Tesla
"Quando a montadora MERCEDES BENZ, vai fabricar o MERCEDES AMG GT, coupe  com 2 portas e 4matic? Ficarei muito agradecido pela informação!"

"You know. I felt like whatching propaganda from they live. Fucking awfull. And i fucking feel like an old man is trying to tell me what to do. Yeah get it, millennial don't realy give a shit all that much about these shitty cars. Yeah all i care is to be lazy, have an idea and sell it. I don't want to work hard for sombody else lol and if i do i want my buck for my money. A prius. Doesnt cost a penny in gasoline."
"Oh lol John Benz allowed comments ... oh boy. Get a real job - spend more time at work. Get married = spend more time with wife and kids. And them spend more time with friends, HA no you just expanded all your free time sorry. So that car is basically telling me get money right? But it costs a lot of money right? Money costs time right? Don't get the car and you will have double the time to spend with family and friends :) Growneded"

I’m having a plastic surgeon install 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins, 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury and an awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me E400 4MATIC Sedan and respect my right to be intelligent and luxurious. If you can’t accept me you’re a benzphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding. Also you can get me at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900."

Hi Mercedez
Very elegant and beautiful car.
Mercedes you have to launch the gt concept ! 😍
Bmw is better!!
"The X-Class is beautiful for a pickup. MB simply has to get their hands in every segment, and they design and produce so many different vehicles and still remain a premium brand. They must have excellent cash flow to do everything."
"9:37 Breast-taking! 😂 Sorry for being immature.

Hilarious the EQ number one - why I'm not surprised? The EV propaganda is all over us - guess what you wont save the planet with electricity - you just gonna make other people rich and that is the whole point :) Enjoy :)
"Was E-Mobilität angeht, haben die deutschen Unternehmen den Trend richtig verpennt. Man weiß eigentlich bis heute nicht, wie sich der Trend weiterentwickelt. Setzt man auf Batterieladung oder doch eher auf Brennstoffzellenautos? Tesla verkauft sehr gut, bauen das Ladenetz so schnell wie möglich aus und die deutschen Firmen reden da was von 2019, 2020... Tesla ist Benchmark in diesem Bereich und ich denke das wird auch so bleiben. Mit dem Model 3 steigen sie jetzt in C-Klasse/3er/A4-Segment ein und die Nachfrage ist gigantisch, genauso kann ich mir vorstellen, dass sie auch ein Konkurrenzprodukt für die SUVs in diesem Segment bauen werden (werden ja gefeiert wie Apple). Wie gesagt, bis Ende 2017 wird Tesla die Anzahl der Supercharger verdoppeln... Daimler, BMW und Volkswagen geben, außer das man demnächst was auf dem Markt bringen wird, nicht wirklich was zu diesem Thema bekannt...."

The most beautiful car !
6x6 station wagon with a larger rear door would be more like a Maybach in my understanding. And the car would be more practical.

Very nice wish I had one 😊
my life is so good the only thing I need is a Maybach G 650 for my safari trips
Es ist wirklich eines der schönsten E-klassen die ihr entwickelt habt. 👍
лучшие из лучших !!!
ok but who designed the S class which you based the e class on? lol
"It took them a year to design the e-coupe? I call bull. They basically just copied and pasted the c-class, which is a copy of the s-class."
More behind the scenes please!
This is love... Mercedes love.
This car looks too much like a c class. I like the distinctive look of the lexus products better.

I've taken my w203 on a leisure trip to the Alps, or in the summer... on coastal roads. Just me and her, the open road and a 1980s balad on the radio.
That's how you show a Mercedes love."
The most beautiful moment of the video 0:52 !!! What the GLE is doing here??)

I don't think it is worth the money.
You should hire new designer! Luxury but boring
Merc runs outta ideas.
"I have the 2014 E550 coupe, and I love the lines of that car.  I wish this one had more lines to give it personality.  It's very bland at first glance, but perhaps it grows on you."
A new classic?
"Nice, I am interested in this car"
In my opinion it looks like any other Mercedes Benz models.
"AMG version in 3, 2, 1... Come on, be quick, Merc!"
"like the overal proportions, but the shapes almost look too rounded and flat
wish there was something in between the hard egde design language of the new Audi A5 and this Coupé ..."

Omg Mercedes is so awesome
"I get the point but next time tell your writers of the commercial that being cool and techie does not necessarily mean stupid as well. Who leaves a hot iron running, all their lights on and the gas burners alight at the same time? Maybe they should not be allowed to drive especially with children inside the car. No amount of tech compensates for stupid like this."

Susie looking gorgeous in a beautiful new Mercedes. Nice...
thank you I need Benz
"As a huge Mercedes fan I will write something here. Daimler, you hired that long time Audi guy to design your cars (maybe Dr Gorden Wagener is here too long as well?). The effect? All new designs are not like 2013-2015 e-class cabriolet/coupe - modern, sharp, just great. They are BULKY, FAT, HEAVY-LOOKING and simply UGLY. This one here above looks like Audi A5 coupe with different headlights. The front looks fat, heavy, not sporty and sharp. Everything too round, too bulky. Again, 2012 SL headlight design (a  brick, ugly kicked brick, not tear like 2015 e-class and 2012 SL) so disliked by SL roadster customers. You updated the SL, but here you offer a brick design. REAR....that is another story. Look at Renault Megan tail lights. Basically... you copied old Ranault design (to S-class, E-coupe, C-Coupe). The question is WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MERCEDES design? Previous design of 2013-2016 e-class facelift so much better than this Audi like, boring, ugly, fat and heavy. Learn your lessons, listen to customers. Nobody looks cars looking like 3 tones whale."

"Today never than ever I have seen such  a lack of original design from MB then never before . In the 60s,70s,80s you know you were looking a MB just because how it looked and others tried to copy them. Today is MB what is coping Asian prettier and more ingenious designs making you to express that a MB is not more than an Hyundai with a star (oh no even standing up star was removed). All of them look the same."
I have always bought your flagship SEC CL Coupes but why would I buy the hideous S Class coupe when I can buy a C Class which looks better. I'm moving out of the Benz until the design language changes and into Bentley's.

the major issue for the designers is how to set the  controlled deformation zones and their biggest headache is the ridgitity of the engine block...you ve seen a superbike accident ...apart from the plastics and the fork the  bike is really one piece...literally one piece...because everything is built around the steel of the frame-engine...!!if they could really move the engine to the back or in the case of the electric cars  the things would be much simpler...!!and the extensive use of plastic or other synthetic materials in the engine area  apart for cost, corrosion-free, and weight factors really helps...with the combination of the airbags and the structural  ridgittiy of the passenger s cabin!!!!!yes  active safety is the number one but you can not always predict....  contol the minds or the road behaviour of the rest!!"
The best or nothing ☺
best car company in the world (FACT!)

3:01 - a zebra only on half of the road. this idea is so idiotic i thought it was made for april fools.
I take stuff
Imagine driving down the road and suddenly a huge arrow appears on the pavement pointed straight at you. Or some weird symbol. This is stupid for other drivers and possibly dangerous. Heads up displays inside the vehicle that only the driver of that vehicle can see seem best to me.
And the pits on the road it will highlight? :))))

I'd like to help Mercedes to do better with Actors
"Whats I'd like to say to Mercedes is that …
I'm a Truck driver and I work and drive only an Actors 2008. I had the occasion to drive the new Actors and ……and ……
Why Mercedes does it?! 
The Actors was a Super Truck. 
It isn't anymore.  Many error made!! 
And believe in Me that live on the Actors."
Sounds very nice...But have you ever driven a Scania with Topline Cabin and R 730 Engine? That's a Truck!

perfect
"It only needs lights underneath, and it looks just like a tricked-out ricer."
HOLY HELL

"We had a wonderful time playing for this press conference. Thanks for having us, Mercedes! Amazing new cars here."
The best or nothing :)
Класс!
S650 and E63 just came into my dream cars list.
"This is honestly thee sexiest car i have ever seen!! Who ever designed the Maybach should get a prize of some sort, 10/10!!"
"ugly, the interior is so generic compare with Dawn."
well well mercedes
this is going to be amazing!!!
There was information about 1 of 300. Its limited edition?
"Mercedes the beeeeeeeeeeest in history , world class !!!!!!!"
"I have had TWO cars on my wish list now THREE.
A 1957 Lincoln Mark II
The new Bentley's
And from the day I saw my first one A MAYBACH...but to be honest I wanted it stretched 3 feet with more leg room in the back as I had no intention of ever sitting up front."
"I wonder if Kylie Jenner will buy it,  she already owns the G-Wagon and the AMG."
I gotta get two of them
bloodclart  😵
Will it be available in Australia?
Warum nur 300 Modelle ? 😭
Can I get two?
So.. 6.5L engine? Probably not
"wow only 300 available. i'd be in ecstatic if i can afford a S650 convertible even without the Maybach add. >,<"
Very nice. 👌
"6,5 liter Bi-turbo V12 AMG"
What the song
I wonder if the suspension is comfortable in that vehicle.
Damn have been waiting for this!
uauuuuuu  + esse amareço e demais....
Mercedes Benz Class G500 6X6.
some marketing tool ass banged a stylist and came up with this bullshit spiel.
front looks good but the back is ugly as fu**
"Be very curious to read  of the reception in these markets to the X-Class. Certainly has the ""rugged"" part down from this view but bed still looks too short for a "" truck.""  We shall see..."
What will be the key markets ?
Шикарен. Ждем на Российском рынке.
4MATIC better be standard.
G-class forever <3
i like this concept but when will the product of X-class be sold in Vietnam?
WOW :-)
"A Nissan NP300 Navara with a Mercedes motor, suspension and badge....  I have one question, WHY??"
"No no no no no NO...!!! 
As an owner of a Merc I am NOT a fan of this direction."
Will it be available in North America at some point?
peinlich... Was ist nur aus Mercedes-Benz geworden?
I love mercedes because they make the most awesome car.  And I'm waiting for the maybach s650.
Official releae date?
If I win 900 mil I will make sure to buy one of these trucks ;)
It's just a disguised Nissan Navara at bigger cost
Price?
vandalism cover? Is this fixed outside of my insurance?
Don't drink and drive.

+Mercedes-Benz hi. The sport+ or the regular sport button drags more fuel than eco and comfort or is the fuel economy still the same in sport as comfort and eco?

Creative Ad 😍😂😉
LOOL Beautiful advert
Keep coming back to this video and wondering why the road going version takes no design cues from this concept car?
Bring on the AMG version already

"Que Perfeita,a se eu tivesse condição de ter uma,Muito Linda mesmo !"

"worst tv spot ever
is it made for super-adhd asperger autists?"
"It's a tough pill to swallow Mercedes, I've alway's known you guy's to make superior cars to everyone else.  Now trucks?  It just doesn't feel like a Mercedes thing to do.  Hope you pull it off."
Wird es ihn auch mit “Kasten“ statt mit Ladefläche geben?
"If this car will be released in 2017, why would you call it a concept car."
Can i fit a motorcycle behind it ?
I have just cancelled my order of the S Class. I am moving to Rolls Royce. The Mercedes Benz brand has been completely diluted
acertou em cheio Mercedes
we don't need any new class anymore
Mercedes-Benz will it tow a boat😂
Wow Mercedes I fucking love you fuck raptor fuck them hahaha

I'm buying one fire sure!
Nissan Navara LOL
Hopefully it follows in the steps of the #G63_AMG_SUV

I wrote you a comment on earlier video. Give it to the guy with the big Mustache  let him read it. Please bring back the real Mercedes cars uniqueness."
"Damn crap what a beauty! Well done guys! G is still my favorite alonside S Klasse, but this baby has great potential, especially for Middle East & USA buyers."
Die eine Dame aus dem Interview hat einen viel zu deutschen Aktzent. Nicht schön anzuhören aber trotzdem ein Like einfach weil Mercedes deutsch ist
Nissan Navara!
"when can we expect to see first specifications of the car? like fuel consumption and engine power, ...."
"If it comes to the states i may actually trade in my 2016 GMC Denali 1500 for one of these!
I am so in if it makes more power than the 6.2L."
that car is so damn sexy good job mercedes

"I'm sorry, but this is ugly as hell."
Very beautiful 😍😍
yes you are okay
Eclass is fine good looking car you are okay keep it up
"Am I the only one who likes the previous E Class (2013-2016) model better? It looked sleeker, more shapely and simpler yet still beautiful and luxurious. It also had pretty wood trims, cool metal air conditioner vents, and not as intense ambient lighting. It also had a real sturdy look to it. Plus it include a CD player which sadly is becoming scarce these days. This one............I don't know, I just like the old one better. But that's just me."
Das Beste oder nichts :-)
"I am very passionate about the Mercedes Benz design, as an Industrial Design student I would love to be part of your design team!"
"Disable 20 seconds ""no hands on the steering-wheel"" super annoying limit, also in the older models via software update. Or at least increase it to 5 minutes and then slow-down the car to 40 km/h. E-class with autopilot model 2013-2016 should decelerate to allowed speed by traffic signs. PLEASE update cars via software update. It is unacceptable, that a car with traffic signs recognition stupidly drives 120 km/h on 100 km/h traffic sign limit. This should be an easy to fix via software update in service. You should really do this and call the latest model cars with stereo-camera and distronic plus / autopilot to service for software update to this problem. I know the new e-class slows down, but what about the 2013-2016 e-class? you forgot about us?"
"Navi should be in the left LCD, not right. I do not want to distract myself while driving looking right. It is easy to cause an accident, especially with a bigger screen and more data on screen. Audi does it right - navi map is in front of the driver. Can you see it like that in the e-class?"
"Second topic is this new e-class is a copy of S-class and C-class. Why are you doing this Mercedes? Mercedes was always proud to have different models looking unique. Now, you are doing the same what Audi does - hard to figure out on the street if it is a C-class or an E-class. Wrong approach and looks like cost saving was behind the idea, not design in mind.
Be unique, not another Audi..."
"Herr Gorden, the displays should have very thin frame and be built-in into the dashboard. Very bad that we see them leaning against the dashboard and with that thick chinese picture frame like look. You need to rethink this design and not forcefully keep putting it in more and more Mercedes models. Thick frame adds cheap look. Integrate displays into design. Use OLED panels and not cheap LCD panels surrounded by plastic. We pay so much for your cars and you offer cheap LCD in this e-class. I saw it in the dealership. The screen is not black. It is grey with light bleeding. All that on 80 000 EUR car? come on Daimler.."
"Mercedes benz viro  on paras 
homatkaa paras auto maan päällä ☺☺🚎🚎"
Much better screen than c-class have.

"0-100 in 3.4 sec!for a sedan that's not even trying to be aero-dynamical,WOW!"
lmao.  Mercedes uses the same music from Porsche
I'm glad Merc is making great cars again.
you can make me one in Green Hell Mango to make up for not hiring me as a Petronas race engineer and giving me some bullcrap HR response. did Niki Lauda get a summer's eve HR response ? it's ok I am crazy anyhow.
unlike bmw mercedes is doing really well i guess. V8 !!!!
"God, just when i thought i was getting of the AMG train for the MotorSport train. this thing is outter this world. imma dreamer stuck between the likes of BMW Ms and mercedes AMGs. like an undecided voter my vote sways at every new release, the day i do get the drive one of these babies i pray to God i take the right one home."
"i have to say im having a bit of a problem which should i buy in the future this or a s class cause this has drift mod and it is super stuning but the s class is more luxurious
il just put rear seats of an s class into this beast love the car my dad has a e55 amg and a c32 and they are amazing"
would you mind to tell me the genre of the trailer music the first and second track ?
Was that the Dos Equis dude driving or what..?  LOL   Love this car!
why a 4.0 instead of the 5.5 used in the previous E63?
"only 3.4 seconds!, M550i with 150hp less + 1.9 tonne can be 4 seconds flat.
I believe that M5 G30 will be faster than this."

Let's hope this X-class truck also finds its way into African and Latin American markets after launch...
the green one looks good .......but I still cant even afford the tires off one of those 20-30-40-50 000 dollar trucks.....
THAT AWKWARD SILENCE AND HANDSHAKE AT THE ENDING LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
MB should consider turning the g class into a pick-up if the x class won't give them the desired sales... but it ain't bad at all.
I'll stick to landcruisers & hiluxs
Ok ok it's going to be in USA market n how much it will sale for   I don't like the bed off the truck but everything look cool

"This is live from the annual motorshow in Geneva, Switzerland not Sweden for gods sake!"

i can't see a space for the licence plates good job Mercedes ^^
Hello Mercedes-Benz.  Love Mercedes always in my family since 1950. Cant have another car...  From when can I buy this pick up ? Like to have in my Mercedes collection...  Thanks for all great tecnology and amazing car you bring to this world...  Klas from Sweden
"As one of the Australians that have spent around $70,000 on their Ute/Truck Mercedes say they are targeting. I assume most didn't spend the extra $20,000 in interior upgrades and body kits (as good as they look) Please give us the Portal axles/Drop gears that are on that 6x6. By all means have the flash interior and whatever self adjusting sway bars in the White truck. But a auto-disconnecting sway bar for the yellow truck while in a super low crawler gear would take over the 4x4 community.

All Australia wants is the suspension setup of the unimog or that 6x6! Plus the tyre inflation system that runs through he wheel hub. They look great but if you really want to take over the market here in Aus and over in the US- You'll make an interior that can be pressure washed inside then dried via heat vents everywhere. Don't tell me it can't be done!! ... :)

Oh and the reason a lot of people have that ""net"" at the rear of the truck. That inspired the rear of the Yellow truck (the one with the sand/dust trap interior and inevitable ridicule for the fire extinguisher) Is so they can leave the tailgate down whilst transporting items longer than the tray such as dirt bikes.  

And while I'm asking santa what I'd like for christmas- Solar tub/toneau cover that rolls from the front (Look at the Ford ranger wildtrack). If you run a ballsy hybrid to get the neigh-sayers on board in Aus/US with a killer crawler gear run by the electric motor and rethink the practicality of that winch's lack of protection. If you make this I'll sell my house and live in the Ute/Truck (and demand a plane ticket to Oktoberfest for my Ideas, I must go back)"
Rough and tumble gritty guy getting out of this truck and walking on to the job site will be a laughing stalk.
"meh, just give me a 6x6"

"Guys, Mercedes-Benz are a luxuruous, rich-pedigree and sohpisticated maufacturer, they wouldn't make a pickup truck, this is just a nissan, that Mercedes are paying to use their badge on."
"Mercedes had a design back in the early 2000's, based on their SUV, at that time would have been prices in the upper 30's, to lower 40's. Mush less S class, much more SUV. If the new version is based on the Nissian TItan, mine was bad ass, but the 4x4, and the 5.7 engine, I got about 15 miles to the gallon. Had it three years, went off roading and hunting often, never broke down."

"If their coupes and sedans have over 100kgfm of torque, how about a pickup?"
TOMORROW!!!
"hahahahaha... I knew it! hahahaha. I always said, ""benz makes such a shit-ton of models, soon they're going to make a pickup truck"".... aaaand here it is! The funny thing is i was just joking. 

Please stop trying to compete with BMW, you're real competition is Toyota, just admit it."

Price? (wish it's enough with the car price)
Haven't Amex and all the others tried the same already? And failed?
lol
I had Mercedes w212 for two years and now upgrade to w213. I'm afraid to say that multibeam head lamps are not much improved . I had more stronger LED lights and better view specially under rain at nights on older w212. I'm honestly not happy with light system on new Merc .

I wish this was in English-language. or make the subtitles stand out a little better. it may be alright on a laptop but on my phone it's awfully hard to read those little words.
My 2016 E class has been at the dealer now for five days after the engine started making strange noises all this after only three weeks. so now I'm stuck driving a loaner C class they should have given me another E class or an S class.
And yet they say 5 series has more tech. The only tech i know is that useless gesture control and that 10 year old laggy as fk android car key.
i buy it
Nice but it would be nice if you also bring a E-Class Coupe which has the modern look and standards of the sedan or upgrade the C class interior. 🤗
"that's why their slogan is ""the best or nothing""  beautiful machine."

It's totally mind-blowing! Like the E-Class 4matic AMG itself!
NICE! Can u make this for every car :D
I'm in love with this cars interior
"Even in 4k the quality is pretty bad. :( I recommend you guys checking out the German Mercedes Benz car configurator, because the quality is far superior to this in it."

Wow the new E-Class interior is Great.
"In the USA, only the new 4-Cylinder E300 is out. When will the V6 and V8 be out?"
Are you worried about the new G30 5 Series with it's luxury and sportiness?
Great car 👍

"While Mercedes post fancy videos of ""close-to-production"" concept electric cars year after year the rest of the industry launched their models and Merc ended up lagging behind. Seriously, they haven't even released the crazy expensive B-class model yet.."

Awesome👌🏻

DAIMLER IS MY CITY.
Great inovation good job Mercedes bravo Germany
"You bozos keep talking about how you are making the new E class better and better.  After driving your cars for 25+ years I can truthfully say this new E class is the worst car I've ever driven, a true piece of garbage.  I have more confidence in a Hyundai than in an E class and if the truth be told, the old E class (body-style W212) weighted about 500 pounds more, greater weight means more mass which translates into greater safety.  Almost the entire new E class is made from aluminum and MB had to make it out of aluminum because MB can never meet the NHTSA standards so they put in this 4 cylinder joke they call an engine into the new E and this car is so under-powered it's not even funny, it's downright dangerous as there is insufficient horsepower for the car to reach safe passing speeds on the highway.  If you care about your own hide I strongly suggest you buy yourself an Audi A6, much more luxurious inside, more horsepower and torque and a 5 star safety rating, the MB E didn't quite make 5 starts on the side impact crash test.  It's your money but unless you can afford an ""S"" class car you're throwing your money away on a name whose time has come and gone.  Lastly, all the  little gimmicks they put in the car, the self-parking system, the Iphone interface and other systems work about 30% of the time, the rest of the time you keep bringing the car back to the dealer who dreams up more excuses why what you paid your hard earned money for doesn't work."

Yawn...
The best car I've ever seen
"Nice idea, and funny :) Good job people!"

Herr Wissmann behauptete schon vor Jahren, die deutschen Hersteller würden sich bei EVs zunächst zurückhaltend verhalten um dann die besseren Autos zu bauen. Hoffentlich geht das Konzept auf.Früher war Nokia DAS Handy . Heute ist Tesla DAS Elektroauto. Viel Glück Daimler!"

Why the massive borders on the the merc displays?
"next time please get a car expert to ask questions, rather than some good looking chic. There's so much useless kit on this car that has no practical purpose. The most glaring one, is that the steering wheel is in the way of the navigation screen. I could go on. I could go on!! come on Mercedes, your better than this. I hope you see sense before it goes into production."
I don't like this further tec looks... I love have Mercedes-Benz looks right now  c e and s class looks beautiful

How are cars like these going to age? like today we see classics from the 50's 60's and 70's how are cars like this going to age over many years? I think we've all experienced an old slow computer will these cars turn into that? Will we have to buy a new car every 3 years cause that ones computers are glitching etc.

Don't like the exterior and this cheap dashboard. Don't like that plastic screen with already outdated interface. What is that long pieace of plastic attached to the roof? No buy from me
In LOVE!!!! Beautiful Mercedes-Benz!
good presentation but who the hell was behind that camera? was he drunk? xP
"Three years until release sounds good.
500 km range sounds even better.
Having a standard and additional (maybe) proprietary plug is the right and only choice.
Standard (?) four wheel drive is also a big plus.

But why have a second, small logo on the hood just centimeters away from the big star? Please leave the small one away.

Why do OEMs have seat adjustment buttons on the doors? 
There they do mess up the flow of the paneling and also need extra wiring.
So having the buttons on the seats looks better and makes the integration cheaper."

"Should have asked this decades ago, move it already and stop making bad, non competitive, weird looking electric vehicles and start making great ones, like Tesla but better. You have the edge when it comes to materials and the driving feel of the car. Merge it with 100+ kWh battery packs and proper cooling and you can gain back some market share. Stop dragging for more time, you're falling behind as a brand. The Dieselgate scandal has already tarnished German credibility."
Is this a concept car or car line?
"Why does every new EV (except Tesla) glow blue? Seriously? People want cars, not spaceships. Nice teaser though!"
"Concept or real product? People are tired of concepts, sell it already. No more vaporware."

The future began about a decade ago when Tesla introduced us to it.  Follow faster.
I see that the mirrors have been switched for cameras. Tesla tried to do this with the Model X but due to government regulations they couldn't implement it. Hope within the next few years this will change
One V12 lover hate this
I'm so excited😆😆😆😆
"no no no no no. nonono. NO! dont do this if this is not electric.

"Und wo soll man die Teile auf Langstrecke dann laden? An einem Supercharger von Tesla? Ups, geht ja nicht! Oder an einer der seltenen, vom deutschen Steuerzahler subventonierten 50kW Schnelladestation, für die es kein eindeutig geregeltes Bezahlsystem gibt und wo man dann für 300 km nachladen über eine Stunde braucht... inakzeptabel! Da können die deutschen Automobilhersteller die tollsten E-Autos bauen, so wird es nix mit der E-Mobilität! So toll ich Tesla finde, aber ich bekomme langsam Angst, dass die Deutschen den (E-) Karren in den Dreck fahren. Bedenkt man wie viel Arbeitsplätze von der deutschen Automobilindustrie  abhängen, machen mir Teslas gut geplante und durchdachte Strategie (weltweites Schnelladenetz, Lithium Gigafactory, Bezahlsystem, Fahrzeuge) richtig  Panik. Wie lange dauert es wohl, ein weltweites funktionierendes akzeptables Schnelladenetz  (300 km in 25-30 Min. ala Tesla) aufzubauen, wenn wir das nicht einmal im eigenen Land schaffen. Wie weit ist der Vorsprung von Tesla wirklich, den keiner in unserem Land sieht oder sehen will? 5, 10, 15 Jahre? Nokia und Kodak lassen grüßen!"
"Wie man es schafft fast 30 Minuten mit nichts zu füllen, als wäre ich an ner Uni-Vorlesung :P
Hätte gerne ein paar hard-facts mehr gesehen und nicht dieses sinnlose Schnick-Schnack drumrum für ne show. Beschleunigung, Höchstgeschwindigkeit, was taugen die Batterien (sprich Haltbarkeit etc.); Kurvendynamic; Bremsverhalten; Auflade-Details (wie lange dauert es, wo kann man laden etc., was für Modelle gibt es) insb. denkt man da an austauschbaren Batterien, wie es mal bei Tesla mal erwähnt wurde? 
PREIS ist vlt. auch nicht ganz irrelevant und lässt dieser sich bei Mercedes auch rechtfertigen? Sicherheit, ...?
Die ganzen neuen Systeme hätte man genauer erläutern können und vor Allem auch sollen.

Innovativ wirken ist ja schön und nett, aber ihr seid Mercedes - seid lieber schlagfertig mit Qualität anstatt mit Bild/Video-Effekten und Englischunterrichtgelaber kombiniert mit der abwertend verwendeten Form des ""Philosophierens"".

So they genuinely do care about your safety because ALIVE customers mean more long-term revenue.
They never stop their style to lowest traction cars.

"Hi Mercedes, I am one of the customers who bought the new E-class, this is my first Mercedes in a while. Just wanted to say that the infotainment system is a pain to use, the controls aren't that convenient and menus are sometimes a bit odd too. Probably you should look at what BMW and Audi do.
Also you might want to address build quality issues. My E-class has been in service for 2 weeks in total due to sunblind fault which they couldn't fix and had to order a whole new roof section. This hasn't happened to my previous car, an Audi A8, which is supposed to be less reliable.
Thank you"

"Touchpad is unresponsive and does not work often.
Lots of ergonomically errors when compared to predecessors
Hazards are way out of reach in an emergency
The speedo on C-classes and base E's are not legible very easily
The onboard computer setup is far too complicated and takes concentration off the road for long periods of time in order to access menus
Buttons need to be embossed, for example on the driving assistance bar, very hard to distinguish the buttons and are far from the view of the road"

either way u still need to employ a driver. the point is to cut cost
Shut Up and Take My Money please.. awesome
And why it isnt here already? My parcels come in a damn loud post car... Oh yes I see there could be made less money with electro vehicles...
"I love the automated cargo space, sendoff with the drones etc. It is a dream to have a high tech customizable and swappable high tech van for work, mobile office, loading, etc. Is the joystick driving really enough control over the vehicle? I could probably design a better futuristic control interface, but that is just from the hardware that I am seeing. Does it have to be marketed only to shipping and transit services? What about mobile offices, and for entrepreneurs.. there is a large market there also. These vans are going to take off into a world of customizable applications, that is what I see at least."
"I personally predict some limitations/issues:
 - Airspace: Flying drones around low to the ground above roads commercially is bound to result in a lot of issues with the law
 - Take off: The van needs to be stationary or at a very low speed
 - Landing: The van also needs to be near stopped
 - Also Landing: The van can't be on a slope due to the way drones fly, unless a landing pad is designed that can adjust itself to the slope on the van's roof

This would certainly be useful regardless. A van can stop to make a delivery and actually be making 3. Or 2. Depends if all the drones see the telephone cables above the van :)

 I don't know what the joystick is for, it feels like it was thrown into the video for fun. Surely the accepted future is self-driving vans but I guess that would upset the delivery van owners if Mercedes admitted that"
Uau!
"Укрпошта, 2016."

Very interesting way of future you designed here. Expecting to be like this in around 20 years.

I wonder if DHL will opt for the package catapult instead of the drone.

Holy shit they've actually managed to make a vehicle uglier then the cube!

"Wow! This is great. I thoroughly enjoyed the coverage. There is room for some improvement though.. Editing for one, get the sound synchronized! I would have expected at least 1080p if not 4k video too. I wonder if Mercedes will consider using simulators being used more to help hone drivers skills. I also think that the drivers could give a lot of incite to how to improve the simulator feel and enhance toe overall experience. I am sure tha it would help reduce costs to Mercedes in fewer repairs to the actual cars from the track :)"
"This was a good idea, but next time show the race. Not the host. Not the commentator. Not the crowd. Not the drivers. Don't interview people mid-race. If you must do these things show them in a little box in the corner, with the race on the main screen. When an accident happens, don't cut away to look at other cars. You can skip the tracking shots of buildings too.

Also, make sure the commentator (who was a great idea!) has his mic plugged in, but you probably know that :-)"

"The suspension is key in the success of this car. Has to be at least as good as RR, if so, this car will break the luxury coupe market."
looks like a coffin

When will you guys make a video of the car inside and out and when will it come out? I really want to see the inside because I can tell it well be very luxurious! 🙏🏼😀
Where can I watch the announcement?

le nom de couleur svp?
my name is Garry and I have this car
Music?
Such a hot car😍🔥
I often ask: Should I kill someone to take such trip?
"Very nice video, I did not feel that maroon was the best color for this car in this environment. I feel that black or white could show off this car as much more elegant and refined, compared to the maroon body that really blended in with the rear lights and did not work the best to show off the curvature and aesthetics of the car in its full glory. Additionally, 4k, some greater optical image stabilization, and a greater aperture in the camera would go a great way in making this video of the utmost professionalism."
Gorgeous!!!
I want one of those
"Good day very cool shot, more video pozhaluysta.I may ask? After what the camera to shoot and what to do after dobovleniya Do not flush the video and it was in HD quality?"

"El transporte del futuro, cuando llegara aqui a España?."

"The bus and its technology is amazing - no doubt about it... Congrats to the team behind it. However the production quality of this video, especially the English language skills of the interviewer can only be described as embarrassing. Would be great if people would take the Mercedes social media outlets seriously."
really what is so good about driverless vehicle.what is the point ?
Good but really nothin is special

The rear exterior looks good but not as good as its previous version
"Любимый *Mercedes-Benz*! Сделайте скорее электрокар E-Class! Я Вас люблю, но если будете тянуть с этим делом, боюсь уйду к *Tesla*..."
MERC THE BEST !!!!
"Yes, it's the best, but how will I get 😔 Thankfully"
"Exactly what I wanted, a bit of c class and a bit of s class."
in the past Italy did better cars then Germany
This is not even compare able to the 5 series
"new E-Class~
i love amg"
Feels like a spy's car
"It`s identical to C class, especially the front. It`s a pity to design in such uniform way, all Benz limousines are almost equal now, except the size. And Coupes as well. I`d rather wait for the new Audi A6, renderings of new Audis are very promising. :)"
best car ever made 😍
What a car😍 Looks nicer than s class interior now
What a car😍 Looks nicer than s class interior now
Why the fucking germans make so epic cars 😱❤️
Is it hybrid ?
"I'm sorry, but the sloping rest doesn't work for me. I miss the elegant lights and the boxier, more luxurious look."
First comment :D
Iv drove this car it's unbelievable and sounds incredible  I want one  but will have to stick with my c63   🤓
wouldn't it produce lift guiding air to the underbody? especially at the longitudinal middle area？
"SLR was a real supercar, this one is scum shit"
You could have muted the original audio. I can hear what i'm assuming is German over the English audio.
Mercedes is go sailing
Which cd index does it have? If we speaks about aerodynamics that is the first data to show.
"Plus, it nicely compensates because it resembles a giant pp."
"Ωραιο αυτοκινητο και ισως πολυ ωραιο , αλλα δε θυμιζει supercar αλλα ενα πολυ δυνατο γρηγορο αυτοκινητο ."
wow they straight up cpied the front of the maserati Alfieri and the back of porche
Nice Color Green /geile Farbe grün!
"Der AMG GT-R hat tatsächlich fast die gleichen aerodynamischen Lösungsansätze wie der Porsche 918...Alles ist schön ""unsichtbar"" verbaut, sodass man nur die Funktion spürt und nichts mehr ^^

Trotzdem ist der AMG GT R eine unfassbar schöne technologische Kreation!"
Absolutely Phenomenal

"The killer of Nissan GT-R

The greatest model in the current Mercedes line and probably the truest Mercedes of them all. Glad they still keep it in the line!
Mercedes G wagon looks much similar to Indian mahindra bolero
"Very nice review. The G class is an immediately recognisable 4x4 that most off roaders would absolutely love to own, or at least have a drive of. If you have the money then why not eh? I recall them being tested in Australia and having a few issues with the rough tracks. No doubt Mercedes would have learned the lessons, which is why they did the Aussie test in the first place, and all suspension frame etc are sorted out. In conclusion ...a highly desirable vehicle."
mercedes i one i world
"No hill descent control? 
Why not add that function?"

"This is more like the garbage of future buses. And by the way, there's no such thing as future anything. If it's built now, it's in the present, the end. People are trying to get places not lounge while in transit. I value comfort above almost anything, which is precisely why this bus sucks! It sucks from any stand point, be it design, comfort, efficiency (both in furniture design and structural design). The bus is not nearly as aerodynamic as it could be. A truly efficient bus is one designed to keep passengers as comfortable as possible, while fitting the most people in the least space necessary and saving as much energy as possible. In fact, it's all one thing. Try putting that bus in busy cities throughout the world and you'll see how quickly people rebel"
Why do they wear a Xyloband wristband?
"This is so unrealistic! The future is to have more seats in a smaller vehicle, not less in a bigger one! Bullshit."
"Mercedes what you should really be doing is putting horizontal motor in your buses in order to maintain the interior complete with seats to the end, MAN has the best buses with horizontal engines, you as any other manufacturer put there vertical engine and there is a HUGE BOX at the end of the interior which looks ugly and takes a lot of space and half of the back window."
rubbish. what is the point of the busses in future if the car's will drive it self? cars always win and  there is no point to build a bus in future
zis iz horibelich mein eyes huert from liestening to ze man spreching

The first sentence already alienated me: I find living in the city a dreadful necessity that I'd be happy to avoid.
the guy didn't excite me. instead I felt like he was giving a lecture
way too less seats
best or nothing
This was such a painful presentation.
Lmfao!!  Who ever buy a bus like this got to be for business people or millionaires to get around. It's a waste of money
"sorry, but the guy presenting the features of the bus has a really bad pronunciation. Either choose someone with a good English pronunciation or let him speak his natural language and add subtitles."
ok they make great cars and everything but for the next presentation PLEASE find a person with a better pronunciation
Future is coming!!!
"sorry, but only arround 12 seats in a 12m bus?"

AMG GT-R!!!😍
proud to have one ... W124 1987 300E :)
What a wonderful story of adventure.  Well done to all involved.
ich liebe meinen W124er......aber die treten die Autos ganz schön....
"Supercoole Sache. Student müsste man noch sein...  Wer weiß, vielleicht als Rentner :-)

Kleiner Tip an Philipp, den ""Mechaniker"":  Anstatt die halbe Klimaanlage mit einem Seitenschneider rauszureißen (OMG!), Löcher in die Motorhaube zu bohren und einen Eurostecker an der A-Saule anzukleben, hätte man die Ansteuerung der Magnetkupplung des defekten Motorlüfters mittels einer Büroklammer oder 10 cm Aderleitung im Sicherungskasten ganz einfach auf die Lüftersteuerung des noch intakten Klimalüfters legen können, denn der wirkt genauso wie der Motorlüfter, nur dass er vor dem Wasserkühler steht und nicht dahinter. Alternativ hätte man auch den Strom von der Sicherung der Nebelscheinwerfer o.ä. holen können, falls das Auto mit einer Viskokupplung ausgerüstet war. Dann hätte man den lüfter bequem per Lichtschalter zuschalten können.
Das hätte lediglich zwei Minuten gedauert, die Klimaanlage wäre noch betriebsfähig gewesen und man hätte nicht das gesamte Kühlmittel (R134a oder gar R12) in die Atmosphäre geblasen. 
Dennoch:  Cooler Trip, bin echt neidisch :-)"
Love it!
I have 2 Mercedes benz w124
"Great cars, great countires..."
W124 is the best car ever made...

Extrem geiles Video! Bin selber 19 und habe auch einen S124 als 220er MoPF2 und träume schon lange von so einer Tour. Das Auto lässt sich einfach mit nichts vergleichen und ist heute noch mehr als konkurrenzfähig...
It's W124... No Commets. Thank You Mercedes-Benz for this Car.
Merc the Best !!!! !!
Das ich bestimmt richtig cool sowas zu machen
Was haben die nach dem Roadtrip damit gemacht!?
"I had to watch when I saw 3 W124! My dad bought new in 1993 (when second generation is showed). W124 E 250 Turbodiesel 4-door sedan with manual 5-speed and 2497 cm3 / 93 kW. It's just amazing-durable loving car, it's just never stop, just going and going. It's on 500,000km now, and still runnig like a day he came out of a factory. My dream is to own 500 E or E 60. Cheers :)"
nice!!!!!!♡
l would love that Road Trip!!
It says 2002 or after manuafactered cars. I Haven 2005 w203 c200cdi. Does it work with newer 203's?
cool wäre es wenn die Freibrennvörgänge des DPF angezeigt werden würden...inkl. akustischer Meldung.. so wie es bei Torque möglich ist.. dann hätte man nicht so viele Abbrüche dieser..
"I genuinely don’t see the point of this? I’m not trying to be purposely negative as people are all over the internet, I just don’t see the point, I have Mercedes Me built into my car and I’ve never used it once in over a year of having the car. If Mercedes concentrated on just making their cars better rather than this kind of thing that would be a better approach. For example, the Audio 20 media and navigation system in this W205 C Class I have is beyond terrible. It is by far the slowest media and most unresponsive navigation system I have ever experienced to the point that Mercedes have no right to subject their customers to it. It takes over 6 seconds for a button click to register, the phone functions are unusable rendering the entire idea of hands free telephony defunct. I’m actually appalled by Mercedes now, I own 4 cars, an E Class, a W204 C Class, a CLA and this W205 C Class. Mercedes have been of no help in fixing the problem. They have just wasted my time on several occasions when I’ve taken the car in to get this looked at and returned the verdict of “yes, it’s very slow, just live with it”. In short, if you want to send people emails directing them towards this product you should do your homework first and see that your customers have other problems to be dealt with in relation to the massive failings on your part in the design of certain things you are fitting in your cars. The worst part in all of this has been that you simply don’t care about your customers. I suppose the number one rule in car sales applies to all manufacturers from the most basic brand right up to prestige brands, once you’ve got our money and we’re out of your showroom, you don’t care anymore."
"I had an adapter fitted on Monday the 30th Oct and a car health check, all went well with the check and the 
adapter was fitted. 
After a day I tried to activate the adapter this was very difficult with no real instructions, 
(I am technical and normally find these things easy to do by the way).
In the end I returned to the garage and spoke to one of your sales reps. The representative was very helpful but was,
I could tell as perplexed as I was. After above one/two hours we got the adapter working, I was please and went on my way.
I then found out that the adapter blue tooth was clashing with the car and my phone connection, the phone was disconnecting and re connecting every 4 to 5 minutes. I re configured all again but it was still happening. I changed phone it still happened.

Today I took the adapter out.
I can’t have the phone not working and get distracted with the messages flashing up on my car monitor.

I have also check on line and apparently this is not an isolated problem.

I think these adapters should not be fitted to any other cars until the problem is solved. If you have a solution please let me know but until then mine is sitting in the deck draw in my office!

Hi Benz! why not the boring smartphone gesture replaced with something like 'press and hold' button on the car's key. Feels like the car is more vulnerable when programable device like smartphone could do such maneuver...Maybe im the only one feeling that..

"Mercedes-Benz made the biggest mistake in the history when it sold it's divisions, for such as the MTU Aero Engines and MTU Friedrichshafen as well as Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Mclaren share holds, while it emerge with these company so called Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz should've never emerge with these companies instead it should have bought shares from BMW AG or even emerging with these private shareholders would have been a great opportunity, Daimler AG should and must retain it's former companies which are now owned by Rolls Royce and MAN, Airbus, Honda."

often resulted in sensual poverty and created cold and arbitrary environments."

"Bei allem Respekt, ihre aktuellen Coupes könnten sie grade in der Front ruhig ein bisschen schärfer zeichnen,  wie bei der alten E Klasse Generation. Dass das aktuele C Coupe fast genauso ausschaut wie Limo und Kombi, dass wirkt zu brav."
2017 new engine 💪
"Das ""Design"" der neuen Modelle ist sehr gelungen, unbenommen. Aber muss man jedem einzelnen Modell ein und dasselbe geben? Früher, zu Zeiten des W204 hatte jedes Modell seine speziellen Charakteristika, die es unverwechselbar machten. Heute sind C und S Klasse quasi nicht mehr zu unterscheiden, und die Front wird ja mittlerweile bei ALLEN Modellen in ein Design gepresst. Schade."

"A number of other YouTube channels, have both an German and an English Versions of their various videos of interest. It makes for a far better viewing experience, if you allow for foreign languages in your presentations...Even subtitles. 
Last week I also viewed Dr Dieter Zetsche, commemorating the 20 Millionth Production Vehicle, at your Sindelfingen Manufacturing Facility. I would have loved this video to have been in English as well. Though Honestly, it did came via an independent German YouTuber's Channel...Luckily I know a limited amount of German, so understood the broad strokes of the conversation.
Keep up the great work, I really love watching Daimler's return to greatness in Product, Engineering and Quality. The Values that drove Mercedes Benz from its inception, through the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and until the late 90's.
Daimler seemed to lose the way for about 10 years. Though since W221, Mercedes appears to be going through a time of revival and renewal. 
Now the iconic Three Pointed Star,  sits proudly atop Bonnets, and in the Grills of vehicles that are worthy of the Mark, and of the Mercedes Benz Heritage."
Einfach genial. Das System gab es vor einem Jahr in den Testwagen und inzwischen ist es Serie. Aber die Medien reden immernoch über andere Marken wie ich das hasse. Naja das ist halt der Neid

.
is that sound this one's.if yes awesome..
this car looks sporty and awesome.i also like glc 250d 4 matic too.love u MB
what's its pricing?
First GLC AMG
"It is great, but I still can't get the idea - why the hell someone going to buy sport SUV - it is pretty much useless off-road, and no matter how good it is can't get even close to a sport car..."
"we have a glc 300 4matic. it's great and all, but you guys REALLY need to fix the mobile app and remote start function. it works only when it feels like. usually once out of every 20 tries. had i known how bad your software was before buying the car, i would have just bought a bmw X3"
"Ooh I like the rear! And the front, but especially the rear"
how much
Thanks
When will the 63 version come out?
MB is really pushing out the AMG sport editions. Nice marketing.
is 43 the New 63?
Why didn't you make a Mercedes-AMG glk???????????!!!!!
Background musics name????
"Why is it a v6 not a v8 
V6 is still awesome I mean it's sounds good but v8 sounds cooler"
It's a very awesome.
this car looks awsome! i think they should make another car like this but with the design of the glk that would super awsome
4MATIC is good.
"it looks very nice in terms of design. guys you know to reduce emission all manufacturers started to downsize engines. So, dont tell bs like they call 4.0lt engine e63 , 3.0lt engine e43. if you dont like the power when you get it(if you can), you can software tune it to increase power to make it 500ps or get bigger turbos injectors, exhaust, intake systems to make it 700hp beast. Other than engine, i am sure it has proper brakes, suspension and drivetrain."
awsome car
This Car is my Car this Car Love so rilli
"AMG = E63 or NOTHING.
Skip this AMG lite stuff."
Good car.
Goodbye 6.3 engine...
2015 e class is the better.
Mercedes-Benz neue Designlinien sind so beeindruckend . Jeder neue Benz wird nur immer geiler
"People, calm down! There's going to be an E43 AND E63 AMG."
"Weiß wer wie das Lied heißt? 
Music? 
Danke im voraus"
"Great car...But if i had it and an E63 pulled next to me, it would make me feel like shit :/ Either go full AMG or just don't..."
Wrong engine sound in video again? That V6 sure sounds a lot like a V8.
"Actually, this looks better than the other E models. I can just imagine what the E63 will look like. 😃"
"I kinda like this version, listening to the notes it seems to me a v6 but not sure"
"Are you guys stupid ? This has nothing to do with the E63 and of course the e63 will come out. This is a ""light amg version"" Its not a true AMG. See it like the C 450 AMG. A few years ago we would say AMG Package but its more than just a AMG Package. 

So there is no need to say ""where is the e63, we want the e63"" . Its something completely different and it will come out ofcourse."
e43 is using a v6
The engine note is from the 5.5L biTurbo V8
"Still not impressed with this entry level '43AMG bs. I understand it from a business perspective but Mercedes is taking this brand dumbing down too far, especially with the introduction of the S400 Maybach (really mercedes, really?)"
I don't like it. It's not as agressive as the previous E63.
Incrível
So beautiful...
Gorgeous place!
what the music?

"The model not available on coupe : GLA, GLS, and G klasse"
good
Shit
"Yeah, let's produce another car that has no real purpose, market, and innovation. Way to go, Merc!"
Where is the GLC coupe concept?
"you don't put and adjective: ""dynamic"" in the same commercial with nouns: ""power"" , ""agility""

use ""dynamism"" for grammar's sake"
Oh god please stop making these horrible hybrids between suvs and coupes
"Обычный Glc и так небольшая модель и со скромным багажником, а купе еще меньше, почти как Gla. Спросом пользоваться не будет!"
"Wow, this caught me off guard. I never expected a coupe version of the GLC, not in a million years. I wonder if they are planning a GLA Coupe and a GLS coupe... Maybe even a G Coupe?!"
4.0 AMG engine?
quiero probar ése coche
"please have an AMG model, FI11iIIIiiii11RST, I think, dunno if I'm first or not, but PLEASE GLC43 AMG for both SUV and Coupé."
Love it
Beautiful machine👌🏼
Your designs are so nice! I want to know how Germans design cars. I am trying to be as good as them you know.:-)
Great video Mercedes! Any idea when the Coupe page will be updated to 2016/17 models on your North American website? It still features the last generation body: http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/class/class-C/bodystyle-CPE
"Hey MB, can you create a website where we can design our own concept cars?"
"Hello Mercedes-Benz one question please. 
i really want to buy one of  your cars but i really cannot take the expenses. 
What should i do ?"
"I have a question 
I see that car in black in the Netherlands with a number plate is it sold 
But this car is a 2017 model 
I don't get it"
Where is c63 amg convertible?
Wish I can switch my W205 to this beauty. Such a perfect car.

So when does the actual new shape of the CLA come out 2019 i assume?  Or are they deciding to keep this facelifet version for a while
We do not want amg wagon
"You know, ""the best or nothing"" doesn't suit this car. Cla is total crap."
echt cooles Auto hat mein Papa
still too expensive for a 4 cylinder car. but looks good
I saw one on the road yesterday with the new led lights
bmw ist cooler
there is a new CLA?
"It's got 4 doors, it's a friggin' wagon."
Looks great!
A great looking Car
rear wheel drive avaible? more horsepower than the 2013 model? newton meter / torque?
a yellow amg one would be great
So is there every new year comming a facelift? Or just once
"""Zwei liter"" wasnt enough for AMG, v8?"
What the Carrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Really i love that!!!!

Does this work on the C-Class?
whats the name of app? my dad and me are searching it but i cannot find..
Will it still work if u don't have a keyless car and u don't have a reversing camera
Does the parking pilot work on the E250 coupe
do I have to turn on something for the brake assist to work?  I have a 2017 CLA 250 4matic couple
"Hi, I have a Mercedes B-180 W246 (year: 2012) with Parktronic. Does the remote parking pilot support this vehicle?"

I read somewhere that the remote parking option is not available in the US. Is that true?
How when the camera is blocked  pleese answer
"Will the remote feature on the app open the garage door, start the vehicle, back the vehicle out, then close the garage door all with the driver standing outside using the phone app just like the Tesla does?"

"I love this Active brake assist . Works well. I own CLA 180 2k18 so some days ago was driving 150 k/h  suddenly traffic slow and all cars stop I wasn’t paying attention til i come near and the car brake automatically i was so impressed and i am Glad that I included this future . Thanks Mercedes “
 Sorry  my English"
I love you Mercedes-Benz
Woow I love this car 😍💖👍👏

I like Cclass
"When i drive my cla some times in danger i see or hear the red Attention warning and i thought that my car has not Break Assist. Yesterday i almost going to crash because when  i drove my cla, suddenly i take a look in left side of me and i didn't realased that the car front of me stopped. My CLA brakes by own and i was surprised.....Thanks MB for the standard Brake Assist. It save me ..."
Does 2018 GLC 300 have this as a standard?
Does the gt63s comes with active braking assist also?
is  e180 2017 exclusive have this?
"Just wondering, where is the radar on a brand new 2017 E Class AMG Estate? I have a had a few ""radar sensor"" dirty messages. Is it the star on the grill?"
it is a standard in every mercedes model?
wow :D
The best.
can we try this with out getting injured?
my mercedes model is 2017 e class how to activate auto drive and what is the app for mercedes to drag it outside the garage or start the car by app can ur plzz explain.
if there is no driver reaction  .... why is the system not going to the hospital ?
Tesla can do better
Speed recognition is not available here.
this is insane
"Is this Drive Pilot the same as in Option #997: Distance Pilot Distronic with steering pilot, that will be available on the MY 2017 SL 550? I look forward to your answer as I am in the early stage of ordering one for European delivery. Thank you."
How long will the Steering Pilot stay active without driver input? Assuming the driver is paying full attention but relaxing with their hands and feet off the wheel?
So does this mean I can text my sidehoe while the drive pilot is on?
Is this similar to my Distronic Plus on my CLS 2015?
What if there is the speed limit of 80kmph on the board but the driver is getting enough space to drive faster than 100 kmph ? Will this system oppose the driver to drive fast ?
"Obviously, all female drivers need one new E class."
Does it work on the old Mercedes to
So I am not longer able to drive too fast? Or is there an option to turn the function with the speed limit off?

poor mans s cabrio
"The 4 Series Convertible has the same metal roof from the old E93 3 Series, which is heavy (adds 300kg), operates slowly, and impractical.

The A5 Cabrio is okay, but I prefer it with the S5 package, but it is dated and a new one is coming soon.

This car however, is the best in my opinion. It has the lowest drag compared to the other cars in its segment. But it is hard to differentiate between the S-Class Convertible, like their Sedan models."

Forza 6 is first c63 amg in game
I love soft tops in convertibles :) 9-Speed gearbox o.O
I think that all those  48 AMG versions will destroy the name AMG used to have. They are good cars but they lack the vibriaton of the earth the AMG engine or noise used to cause.
Tobias you are mental. 48 models? You think AMG must be something like Porsche?
How do they make the cars look so clean and shiny?!
Nice !!!! How about c63 convertible ?
Looks good. When will the 9G-Tronic gearbox come to the C63?
im excited for the c43 amg 4matic!

What kind of car advertisement is this? There is no car!!!
mmmm nice places. thanks you mercedes. i clicked on your video to look at the landscapes not the car.
"No offense but many of you don't get it. This advert is not about showing off the new C Class, but more about putting into perspective what it is like to travel and live the moment, to catch a glimpse of short but powerful images we all get when visiting unknown places (was it Madrid in this video?), and traveling in general (in a car, on a train, you name it). I have personally always found Mercedes ads very inspired and well directed. As an amateur photographer, I tip my hat to the filmmakers!"
Wonderful clip about road trips!
so many feelings...
I can't justify the amount of work put for this single promotional vid. Barely even got to see the car itself.
nice

very attractive car...  since they came out here in Los Angeles I've seen five... 4 sunrooftop ones and one rag top... for some reason no one seems to be buying them.
we have a model very similar to this same color and rims n everything however ours is the sedan version with the 3.0 biturbo
seats are super uncomfortable and does not fully recline for me to nap on..
"Weird... I like the 4 series way more than the 3 series, but the C Class looks so much more balanced as a saloon/sedan than as a Coupe. Nice, but I'd take the 4-doors."

"Beautifull car, shitty commercial!"
no push button start? they lost me right me there.
Best car for the price
you have to feel it to understand...
As my nickname says I'm a MB fen... but most probably I'll never buy Mercedes because there are no proper manual transmissions. If someday i buy one it will be classic one - the one that built MB reputation.

Is there a video of the Maybach ?
Nothing is better than Mercedes-Benz! I have a C-Class estate which is the definition of luxury and space! My dream car would be the Maybach. That car is insane it is so nice!
It's not AMG!!!!!!
It felt as if Mercedes was intentionally hiding and diverting our attention away from the rear of the car as there wasn't even 1 proper sharp shot of it. Perhaps they themselves felt that it's not the most appealing part of the car. 
Can't wait for my C63S coupe in April! Such a stunning car even here in regular form.

The one with the most data and the best capability to make use of it will eventually win the race to autonomous driving.
"Also, what trim level was this particular E-Class, and what engine did it have and what specs was it fitted with?

Many Thanks! ;-)"
"Hi there, just checking, is the trim level SE, AMG Line, or a special pre-production trim level?

Many Thanks! ;-)"
Can a Tesla. bake an pizza .Or substitute the 3pulse. conection.  phase 3 GMH. Bliszten.
"Very interesting technology, but the paint job seems a little busy.  I hope that's not the only option. ;)"
Is it safe to drive?
"Sure. Show new ""AUTONOMOUS"" driving car on a flat empty straight road. Level: mercedes..."
so is that fully autonomous or semi like tesla?? and can we get software updates in future like tesla??
Mercedes-Benz is outstanding in the autonomous cars market
"This car is VERY beautiful, inside and out. I hope to be able to afford a Mercedes soon."
"Autonomous driving must stay an assistance for the driver. The problem is that it's more and more becoming independant and it will soon not need any interaction of the driver. The driver must stay the master of the car, not the intelligence of the car."
I would like to have this feature on my S class
I think it is annoying to slow down the car automatically when the camera saw a sign.... Maybe I am in a rush and I want to drive faster...
Oh god... that english!!

It is the end of naturally aspirated engine? :'(
Die m Klasse ist nen Geländewagen wär überrascht als ich das Auto gesehen habe
Thanks for video
aunque mercedes tenga el mejor y alta tecnologia e ingenieros desde años 70 para producir buenos vehiculos como este 240. (versatiles y que en realidad ecologico y contamina menos. puesto el vive 5 y no se sabe cuantas veces mas que un vehiculo actual.. esto implica el ahorro de la contaminacion industrial en procesos de fabricacion)  Estos de mercedes  ellos ahora solo estan trabajando al 35% de su capacidad de desarrollo...  porque asi demanda el mercado de consumo..  mejor producir mas y mas barato y mas rapido fuera basura..  (BASURA CONTAMINA SEÑORES... MUNDO ES REDONDO=FINITO)  PENSAR CON CABEZA DE INGENIEROS AÑOS 70 PORFAVOR  UN MUNDO MEJOR ustedes grandes del futuro colaborar un poco. y grandes resultados para la humanidad
who did this story/video?
i love the video but what he is saying doesn't match the subtitle
"my ancle worked in taxis in morocco have the same mercedes  hes been working with it since 1985 she had like 3 or 4 millions kilometeres,  you can say everything you want but german industry is very strong especially mercedes brands a"
Car original + city original = Original
"Uawww what a beautiful film, about a beautiful car. I have one exactly like that one, and also bought in Morocco in 1976. My
 car, came from Morocco to Malaga in Spain and from Spain to Denmark. I have the original papers and documents from the very first owner. The car is now in Sweden and I treat it as a family member, of course. It starts every time :-)"
Toyota also makes grate cars better cars
This is the real Mercedes... now the new Mercedes cars are so shit like renault or peugeot.. sorry for that but is true
"please MERCEDES make a new model of 240  for morocco .. you can sell thousands of them ... last week i came from saidia to oujda and i was riding in a volkswagen caddy taxi .. evan though i had my own seat but the travel experienxce was off, i mean when i travel with mercedes 2 persons ride in the front seat ( the driver has it's own seat) and 4 in the back seat so when arriving in destination i always dont feel my right ass part or i could not hear whith an ear .. i mean that is the beauty we grow up with ... those feeling .. the feel of the tightness in the back .. now they start using VW caddy ..dacia lodgy ..fiat and ssongyong...where is the governement ? a unique moroccan signature is dying ..."
i think mercedes is the only car that can be used as a taxi in morocco it's really patient and strong ! Mercedes is the perfect german masterpiece!
Mercedes taxis are lefting Morocco and Dacia taxis are coming to Morocco.
my fellow moroccans complaining about the translation... come on if they translated it word for word it wouldnt make sense in english they did a good a job and they got his point across that he loves his mercesdes and that it never let him down since he had it. enough said. nice to this!!!
The translation is soooooooooo unfaithful.
Vive la Mercedes <3 !!!
rb3a ou ts3in a wlad l9hab
Moroccan government would like to change this beauty with Dacia
Best taxii hhh
Such a shame that the new Mercs don't last half as long as these miracles.
"morocco has maybe the bigest mercedes 240 fleet in the world, this model is seen everywhere even in the smallest far away towns in atlas mountains, the authorities are trying to force those drivers to change their cars even giving them discounts and non-fees credits to obtain some ridiculous french trash, but they refuse :) they want mercedes :)"
I love it mercedes benz cla

"""Never stop challenging "" according to Mercedes , it's literally plagiarizing (and poorly) a sequence of the Tree of Life by Terrence Malick. 
Probably because a shitty copywriter in a shitty agency submit ""his script"" to the marketing moron of Mercedes who had not seen the film. 
Never stop challenging ! What a joke !"
Sexy as fuck!!!
"This car is graceful, exquisite, elegant, but powerful and sporty at the same time. This shape is charming and provoking.  Simply brilliant. Thank you, Mercedes-Benz, for another piece of art."

what's the exact color of 1:31 ?
I am a very very big BMW fan but Mercedes you did a very good job with this car
which is an application used for animation
I love you Mercedes !   ;-)))
I like this new E-Class for its looks as a luxurious executive car... I don't know how they will make it look aggressive for the E63... I have the current E63 and that looks great in the current body.
ЗЕ БЕСТ О НАФИН
+Mercedes-Benz these options are standard or do you need to buy? im driving E220 diesel 2015 and i would love the wagon version 2017 for my wife
Go Forward Mercedes Benz 😘
Good thing I decided to wait on buying the current E Class. But I need to wait another 7 months or so before I can buy the new E Class... This is torturous.
German engineer at it finest

"no more people die on the roads ... This technology is angel for the people . Safe driving , no more human error ! Good work Mercedes ! I have the same principe in life : The best or nothing ! For this until now i don't have a car ! Because i don't want an old and bad car !"
Where did all the good things about cars gone??!!!

"Mercedes pulled an ""Audi"" on us with the interior and exterior design...."
"Why not add the long wheelbase version which is available in China? Does anyone really believe that a ($50k) variance from the S Class would materially affect S Class sales? I believe the LWB E configuration would be a natural transition from E to S as an intermediate step as the customer's discretionary income increases. Is it really a revelation that people are getting taller and need more room? Ok, so I'm 6'5"", but more of my grandchildren and their friends are looking me in the eye."
Why all last Mercedes look the same?
все похожие друг на друга ( зачем под S222 сделали?
"The W223 S-Class would be a statement, the technology would be insane!"
So they all look the same now. I like the looked the of the  current gen e class and even the the previous one but now there are 3 s classes with different prices tags. Underwhelming and disappointing.
Mercedes should start producing electric cars
Фантазии не хватает им

MERC THE BEST !!!!
E class used to be amazing
The best or nothing
The best or nothing
This better not be the new E-class...
Hello it's me again
The Best.
All the best! Mercedes!!!
The front-lights doesn't fit with the rest of the car.  Just the lights alone are looking great.
"This video is like "" Hey, look! We've got LED Headlights on w213!"""
"I really don't understand why did you have to make all classes the same. As I can see in the comments below I'm not alone in this statement. C and CL(now S coupe) has always been similar in the exterior with an S class, but now it's inside as well. As I can see from your teaser video the E class will be very alike too, with that air vents, dual screen, etc. 
By that you're pushing away your S class customers -with their statement of ""Why should I pay 40 (or more) thousand euros for the premium S class if I can buy an E class, or they won't even buy any of them because they all look pretty much the same.
I'm not saying your new models are ugly, I very much like the design, but for God's sake you have to make more obvious differences in your future models!
 
Sincerely, yours enthusiast!"
THE SONG IS CALLED DSHB-EMME TRAP
I used to love the E Class but this is disappointing

"Mercedes is good
las Vegas is bad"
"This was a extremely stupid video foe the E-Class because it's at night time and there are no street lights.  The E-Class sedans, center one looked camouflage and were driving pretty fast and camera only pick out the silhouette of each car and both the end cars were in dark colors like black!  So basically, you are left in mystery.  Ugh!"
Hello it's me again
Е-класс потерял свое лицо. Теперь вообще все модели стали похожи друг на друга.
"saw was you did there.

whats name of the song plzzz ??

Is the world premiere going to be in CEOs 2016 which is held in Las Vegas?
My lovely Machine
"if i own a s class i sell it immadiately.. because i pay lot of money but it seems like a c class and e class..this is really s*** ..All brands make smilar models but not copy models ..Bmw is on the rihgt way. All models have smilar character but not copy. 3 series, 5 series ,7 series all of different."
Hätte ich das geld...
for fuck sake why they had to make the beautiful e class into an oversized ugly c class..
None of the bystanders paid any attention to it
"and this E classe smash 5 series and a6 for sure.
Look at that car,is a beauty"
"tobozoff u are talking about mercedes they are Look the same but the bmw are not? u dont know Who is 7 or 5 or 3 and the interior are the same too.
same Word for audi"
Love the cars and the presentation video!!!
"I love how CES also stands for Mercedes-Benz's class names for their ""top 3"" models"
"Cool presentation, I'm not too excited for the looks however. Loving my 2015 E400 though!"
Nice Car and nice soundtrack. Does anyone know the Name of the title?

Mercedes Benz besser geht es nicht. ❤
"that's a revolutionary design...oh,wait,they already used it in the C and S class...never mind then.."
I hope the E class retains it's more masculine design :/ with strong rigid lines.. Hoping it doesn't turn out to be like the c class :/
BMW will strike back with it's new design!!! :D The Ultimate Driving Machine!
No pain for this car...

MERC THE BEST ! ! !
"Amazing video!!
You guys can probably make a ""making of e class"" documentary. Would love to see that :)"
"It seems they have finally lost all those dreadful years of unreliability and cost cutting associated with the Daimler-Chrysler years and are beginning to over-engineer their cars again. I'm hoping that in 20+ years or even 30 years, people will still be driving the W213 E-class and it'll still be working fine, just like how the W124 is still serving it's proud owners without breaking a sweat 20+ years on."
0:56 what is this model?
I will never buy a Benz anymore.My E class  broke down more than 4 time in 2 years time. Their quality check was awful. Can't they check the imperfections before selling to us? I was totally disappointed of Mercedes Benz's bad quality.
"Looks great, glad to see the 'after-thought' navigation display is gone. I'm liking the E-class again."
The best or nothing!!
"Best or Nothing for sure, because no one else come close."
I'm buying this by 2018.
Mercedes is the best car in the world !!!! God bless these guys who work for Mercedes <3 I appreciate them !! Germany <3 ^__^

Hence I figured why “ The Best or Nothing”"
Mercedes the best or nothing !

"why people dislike this vidéo
because they are jealous"
What is the different between the slk and the slc???
มาสเตอร์เบน
slk geiles auto wie immer die benz jungs habens drauf
"Beautiful environment! Croatia, Pag."
mercedes has to change this form of disgusting front lights it looks ugly old and totally wrong
Looks Dated
"Will Mercedes offer a v8 4 litre amg engine in this car? SLK did have, didn't it?"
"The biggest mistake is the name of the car, an AMG model without an AMG ""handmade"" engine. It should be called SLC 450 AMG  instead of AMG SLC 43. The double digits should be reserved for cars with authentic AMG engines."
wow
so it looks like we going back to the future with the sel slc glc and stuff
"im gonna trade my 12 merc slk for this, this updated car is better than i thought"
merc the best !!!
Why an slc when there's z4?
can you say rehash?
What about 43amg engine?
great job mercedes 👏🏼
"glk -> glc
slk -> slc
-> warum?"
"Ugly, bring back SLK R171."
"Why SLC? Its nowhere like the original R107 SLC...
The S-Coupe should've been called SLC, while the SLK remained as the ""short"" SL.
The new names are too confusing."
Mit Konkurrenten wie dem Mx-5 hätte ich ein bisschen mehr als nur eine Namensänderung und einen unwesentlichen Facelift erwartet..
Merc am Besten!
why use so much electronics? it ruines the car.
I LOVE MY MERCEDES BENZ
"I like the E class the way it is now! Luxurious and beautiful but simple at the same time. This one is way too over the top fancy and gaudy! You don't need a screen that big, your eyes should be on the road. Also no CD player? Considering the expensive price that is a rip off, some people still use CDs and prefer them instead of using smartphones/iPods! Also I wouldn't trust a digital speedometer. That should alway be analog. Also it looks too much like the C class combined with the S class! Sorry but I like the current one better and don't think it should change! :("
"If this is the new e class, then how will the next s-class be like? Well done to MB once again. The best or nothing!"
quelle  intérieur dieux tous puissant la perfection est la c'est Mercedes
Dieux créa la terre Mercedes créa la marque ultime

"can someone explain in developer point of view how those fully digital dashboards are developed.such as what kind of computer behind,what softwares are used to designed the GUI and whats languages used to development logics and algorithms."
The interior looks like the S-Class
The Interior is share with w222
Привет
"Thanks for such a beautiful car! Of course, each car is unique! But Mercedes is special and each time it brings an innovation!
Thanks again and I wish you to make better vehicles!"
nice Interior .Everyone can feel it.
"I smell a lot of Apple concept bullshit in this ad from the design of the dashboard themselves to the way this video is filmed and the guy talking, they seem to have been inspired heavily by Apple!"
Just another boring ass mercedes
Buenos vidio en YouTube
Simply beautiful!
"Beyond lame and dated!  Look at all those dinosaur buttons and even a clock....LMAO!  Mercedes, because you can't afford a Tesla!"
looks just like the S-Coupe inside.. I kinda like it.. then again I wonder what you guys will do with the next S-Coupe. To me the S-Coupe interior always was 10/10. Guess I'll see 15/10 in the next S-Coupe :p
cool

Hello it's me again
Amazing! I am excited to see the interiors of the AMG cars coming this year.
Luxus pur !!!
Beautiful interior. Sucks that it still has an ancient patrol engine though. This interior with electric drive like a Tesla would be a match made in heaven.
"Only American convervaties use American-made cars. If decent price and energy saving are main concerns, we have Japan/SK cars; if power and complexity and high-class feeling are main concerns, we have Germany cars."
"Coming from a lifelong BMW owner, WOW!  I might have to check out MB. That's of course unless I go with Tesla."
I saw the rear.
Это s класс?
"well mercedes always make people 'wow' everytime they release a new generation of c,e,s, etc .  then the interior also the exterior often dated quickly. But i think this time the interior will still amaze anyone in 3,4 years. Now you will hardly find the difference between the material and convenience in c , e , s class. Lexus, Audi, BMW will be losing more and more customers to Merc!"
"Awesome!!! Mercedes: Incredible car for one incredible person, you. :)"
Please Mercedes make with this interior a car for 7 pasengers like R-class?  People with big families we want cars with driving pleasure and interiors like this!  I hope my wish becomes true!!!
"I love this interior! But at the same time I absolutely hate that Mercedes is following in BMW and Audi's footsteps, which is trickle down design. I mean it C, E and S used to be 3 very different cars and an S class would just stand out. These days you can't even tell if you just saw a C or an S. And now a 50k E's interior looks almost as good as 90k S's which is good for somebody who is going to buy an E but not so much for an S class owner. 

Anyway, I'm excited for the 3rd generation CLS, I already know what the interior will look like, now I have my fingers crossed that Mercedes will not mess up with the exterior design."
mercedes Benz you are the best
"Danke Herr Zetsche! Danke Sindelfingen! Danke Mercedes! 

Danke, das sie die beste Autos der Welt machen! Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meine C-Klasse (w203).
Mein nächstes Auto wird auch Mercedes sein!"
I hope one day I shall get a job in your company =)
My '84 W123 280E Sedan came from here and still amaze me every single day! #DASBESTEODERNICHTS
hail Germany!
Thank you Sindelfingen for producing 11 excellent cars for 3 generations of my family! Keep up the great work!
"mein Werk, mein Stolz. Love Daimler, Love Germany, Sindelfingen"

hey where are the new trailers for the c class coupe like the ferry and break tv commercials?
"нищеброды дрочат, а мне пох, я хозяин нового мерена)))"
I like the car but in the game it is an DLC if you want to buy it you have to pay money
The best or noting
Love this car 😍🔥
Music was perfect for video
U can tell which one is which with the one that doesn't say Mercedes on it being the Forza car
The DLC GTA 5 Car now look like GLC
First game appear this car
"Well it's interesting because Gran Turismo series features these  GT concepts  that are so revolutionary because the manufactures make it a real life concept for the game, so I can't wait until Mercedes has a crack on GT.Anyway forza 6 looks stunning and includes my favourite car  manufacture."
Song is Kaveh Cohen & Michael Nielsen - Supercharged.
PS1 and Half
wow best graphics
"Jo como mola, qué guay, Mercedes es Mercedes es lo que hay, jejeje, ñamñam, 🍷 🍷 ok?"
This ad does not do Forza any favors. They should've used a target render instead of raw gameplay...
BGM = supercharged by Kaveh Cohen
"i like this BGM, any source? Many Thx:)"
روعة
FM6 should of come to PC as well.
amazing
"""Blurring the lines between virtual and reality"" xDDD. This is not Gran Turismo, Mercedes!! xD. No even close!! xDD"
"Future CLS, I think 2018 CLS has already accepted IAA's DNA."
"It's a good design and I like it.It doesn't necessarily need all the moving parts,but it seems cool for the future.If this is indeed the future It should be fitted with a pure electric engine that lasts long.That's my opinion but still a great car.One of my favorites so far.Can't wait to see it on the road one day!"
Top Gear Test Track?
Any thoughts about the soundtrack?
"honest opinion, DONT LIKE the rear design"
"Inside doors are small it would be hard to get in to and out for big people, a little disappointment from Mercedes-Benz."
"Not a bad design. But with all these extra ""moving"" parts in this car I'm afraid it tends more to malfunction. Then again, it is Mercedes. You can't go wrong there :)"
"EIN full neue concept, und still need, put the car next to a plane let me remeber ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿AVENTADOR!!!!!!!!!!!!  alte idee"
ICH FINDET DAS GEIL  SCHÖNE DELORIAN 2016 HAT SIE GEMACHT jaja
"acayip şekil değiştirdi. ilk başta doğan slx ti, sonra concept car oldu. umarım seri üretime geçer yollarda görürürüz. burdan tasarım ekibini aylarca uyumadan çalıştığı için tebrik ediyorum."
der nächste Auftrag kommt bestimmt.
Back looks fantastic the rest not so much...
That must be the ugliest rear end of a car ever to have come into existence.
Oh nein bitte nicht :D
"the tech and engineering are inspiring, but damn that's an ugly car."
its a piece of shit I Hope Who this isn't The future

It's in the car
Yeah because you need a computer to park in that space....
i love mercedes
"Jo que pasada, estar ahí que envidia pero sana eh! la verdad es que me gustó mucho, es que Mercedes es Mercedes es lo que hay, un saludo, jejeje, ñamñam, 🍷 🍷 🍺 ok?"
"The Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon be like  ""We changed the transmission, upgrade the power to the same figures as every single other v12 [Just as we already did with the last one (630bhp/621hp)], changed the body panels shape and installed new software so it´s an ALL new car"" Really nigga"
merci~~
all MB managers in this video sound like they know absolutely nothing about their cars. such a shame
"So the ""new"" SL is just a facelift of the outgoing R231, right? They're making it seem like its a whole new chassis / generation"
Das Beste oder nichts
Old mercedes cars were durable and still are like w140 but now it's all about changing car parts every month :( electric cars are the future no need for oil change and so on
The interior is exactly the same....
prodigieux et magnifique
MERC THE BEST ! ! !
it has a mercedes logo  on the front and on the back side
"interior of the new sl and gls are disgusting, because so old"
Now the new Mercedes GLS with 4 tires and a driving wheel !
merci~~
he's a seller not a reporter :D
Mercedes-Benz V-Klasse ist Comfort. Das Beste oder nichts
what the fuck! I like this beauty's
I will collect AMG C63s coupe. It's absolutely.
Going to LA Auto Show next week!
Best or nothing. We're MercedesBenz. Love Daimler. Love Sindelfingen Daimler
Nice!
Great
Fun... and cool!
Where is challenge 4???   : (
Very nice! Keep challenge!
I'd like a go...
I'm saving up for one 😂
Only good if it's in black!
"Good work, Mercedes! A new one for the ages! 

It has a very ""Gran-Turismo""  look to it!"
No car compares to a mercedes benz!!!
"hello to everyone all over on Google. I'm from Boston,mass."
"the new headlights of this generation is really a disappointment. Mercedes should stick with round headlights. Really sorry to say this but this SL is the ugliest in a generation, especially the front."
stunning!
Where are those big massive headlights? :( M6 > this
the most beautiful car mercedes has ever made. but why it is so underrated?? AMG GT is in comparison way too overrated !!! the SL is clearly nicer than any other model from mercedes.. also better looking than the s coupe (which rear end looks realy ugly!!) which is also way too overrated !!!! i dont understand that.. the SL is soooo much better looking but everybody speaks about the s coupe or AMG GT ?!?! is good taste so rare?
the most beautiful car mercedes has to offer.
This is great because the old SL front look like the SLK but this new one its look like the amg gt make the price fit the car. Nice Mercedes.
awesome car but really a shame the germans are so bad at positioning their cars properly. always product and technology nothing about lifestyle
"the old sl Look behind are back and in Front, the New Mercedes gt look. love it. love Mercedes. love Sindelfingen Daimler"
Although it looks better then the car it replace I'm really not a fan of this new grill styling. The 2008 R230 facelift was much classier car...  but non of these can compare to Mr. Bruno Sacco masterpiece SL R-129.
Lovely design. I like the new front end design. Mercedes is always delivering the best there is.
Fantastic! Love it as much as R230!
"daddy, I want one...."
"Genius, the blue car looks soo nice."
"Very good design,I like Mercedes."
When will the SL65 AMG come out? That's my favourite Mercedes!
+Mercedes-Benz glc plug in hybrid is not availble in sweden why? Thanks

"fuel consumption, hopefully there would be a look forward to balance the cunsumption to even more economical especially for the gls 550 and the gls 63 amg."
What does GLS stand for? Grand Luxury Sport?
I really like that sound!
How much does it cost in UAE?

Why not in spanish? She's from Mexico and he talk spanish. Just say. / ¿Por que no en español? Ella es mexicana y el habla español. Sólo digo.
"Great job in México, Nico. :)"
So what has this got to do with Mercedes-Benz? Apart from the fact that they're ferrying Nico Rosberg around Mexico City in a Mercedes-Benz. Looks more like a tourism ad for Mexico.
What is the title of the background music?

I was there when there :)

What the hell am I watching?
What's the song?
"primary school kids here freaking out about how cool is this car... damn this car is just a piece of cr@p, who the hell would drive that.... oh wait, it drives itself, why would somebody want a car like that ? that's not a car , that's a kind of a toy for a little kid or a car that could be in an arcade game, kids love colourfull simple rounded things... real men won't ever like this car because it sucks! MB designers probably died and their kids started to draw  circles and funny thing.... dunno about safety, pole crash could be kinda tricky , what about the top of the car ? how much can it take without crushing the people inside ? I hope this thing stays as a concept because it's ugly as hell !
You must go back in time when you made good and nice cars ! Something else, why is MB the best or nothing, unless is not the safest, can't be the best, unless is not the most luxurious, can't be the best, unless it can't be the fastest it can't be the best, unless it can't be the most reliable it can't be the best so please, don't be german like when you advertise your cars ! stupid people believe everything they see/hear....
And you should fix that thing with rusty body after 10 years of lifetime... bruhhh..."
This is so un-Mercedes.
"SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK SOO COOOOOOOL ONLY 5,000,000,00 POUNDS DOLLARS WOAH"
Its amazing! !
Mercedes best car in the world <3 !!!
"I am not particularly fond of the styling, but it certainty is unique!"
Intelligent !!!
"ok the video...out of this world.. my god best car advert ever..now the car is cool as well, unfortunately this is a car that it will never be built. no chance at all."
Of course there's anime

My gosh! A work of art!
This is just an epic legend of a car :)
simply gorgeous
Love the camera work :D The car and the story are spectacular!
"I owned one for two years beautiful car, terrible gas hog, ghastly automatic transmission."
"I bought a 1973 280C from JG Francis and Mercedes Motoring for 36K. It was not what I expected. After receiving the car, I spent an additional amount on mechanical repairs (coupe was getting hot and would die in start/stop traffic) and15K on rust repair - JG told me it was rust free. While he gave me $12 for rust repair, in my opinion he should pay for ALL rust repair. At the time of writing, it has been in the shop for 6 months for repairs (I have had the car for 6.5 months). 

Before I received the car, I spoke with JG. He said the car was complete. However, agreed upon work was not done. The items included repair of headliner, replacement of wood dash and horn. After receiving the car and realizing the items we not not completed, I called JG. He said, oh, yeah, I will send you the wood and horn so you can have them installed. Only after I mentioned I was required to pay for the installation I had already paid him for was he willing to consider reimbursement.

All said, bad decision."
I hope that oneday I can obtain such Automotive Quality
"wow what an elegant machine to see!!!!!but,it is very difficult to find spare pars like headlamps....."
"In my opinion, these were the days when Merceedes-Benz were Merceedes-Benz. I liked the big classic chromed front grille with the three-pointed star. The interiors were absolutely gorgeous with a workmanship second to none."
"i Teared up watching this Video.... enough said.

thank you for sharing."

"Mercedes, ihr seit die Besten! Ich bin schon auf diesen Sonntag in der F1 gespannt."
Nice content: keep them coming!
That's why they should have invited Hamilton :D
The entire track has just 7 turns  and probably less then 1 mile - for 7 turns and stationary start and virtually equal time is really respectable achievement!
haha not fair 😂😂😂 Martin had a flying start Nico not. so It's not equal 😂😅
but Kaymer had a flying start :|
use a proper track
Really? maybe the track is too small
langweilig
"Jeder bei Daimler schämt sich für diesen Wagen, warum hyped ihr den jetzt ?"

"Die Qualität ist deutlich schlechter geworden, bin gestern in einem GLE (neu) gesessen und die Schalter haben gewackelt wie in einem alten Skoda (bevor VW das übernommen hat)  ...  Wieso muss es in den Autos immer Leder sein?  warum müssen Tiere elendig sterben nur damit Lederüberzüge möglich sind, kann man ´nicht mal Stellung beziehen und sagen, so nicht ?   Ich wollte einen GLC kaufen, leider ist der Monitor so unfassbar hässlich, dass ich mir das Ding nicht anschauen kann auf längere Zeit und fast 4000 Euro für dieses Online-Service ist doch eine unfassbare Frechheit."

"Looks modern and cool , but to drive this masterpiece you need and equal roads and last time I checked (at least in Germany ) even on the famous Autobahn there are serious problems and bumps that could easily make a car like this to fly ... seriously people ,we need better streets and not only highways . There is no street crossing through town or villages without issues , there are streets one lane only and busses meet with other vehicles and they both need to stop in order to avoid any accident . You can't enjoy driving this thing under those circumstances ."

"Mercedes Benz a Neds brand to laugh at and it gets even funnier with the AMG piles of rubbish full on chavtastic. 
I cant help laughing at any Mercedes its rubbish tremendous .

"The epitome of German comedy AMG its utter rubbish allways good to laugh at any Mercedes chav chariot they are really fast :) and so reliable.! German chav rubbish 
Have you met your sales targets this week :) I wouldn't pay 10p for this shed on wheels its embarrassing and the AMG sticker makes it even more ridiculous still. I know Wolfgang lets stick a rubbish AMG 40 litre engine in a Hillman Imp it might go a bit faster :) German tat personified."

"Beautiful looking car with an awesome interior but Mercedes should focus on electric cars instead of focusing on increasing shareholder dividends by continuing to pollute the environment in year 2016 where global warming is a serious threat. As a fanboy and supporter of electric cars, the idea of having a car with an internal combustion engine sounds as ridiculous as owning an internal combustion engine laptop."
The front and the sides are fucking beautiful. What a fantastic car!

"I wonder if this is just me?  I find initial batch of images and videos of the C205 looked too soft, too round and not dynamic enough.  However once I had seen a real life C-class coupe at showroom, it certainly looks a lot more sporty - and subsequently I begin to see lots of real-life photos and YouTube videos all showing a very sporty and elegant C205!  Awesome car indeed."

"My new 1/2015 E250 cabrio was produced in mid January 2015. It turned out I don't have Mercedes Me, Connect me, the refreshed comand online. Just a few weeks later a new updated Comand Online and smartphone app connections is installed. Something is very wrong here, Mercedes. Even if you officially introduce your new functions in March 2015, all cars produced in 2015 should have the new system installed. I hope somebody from marketing and somebody from development team in Stuttgart will read this and think what they do and how customers see such practice. Customers pay attention to what they get. The fact my new 2015 car has old system despite it was about to be introduced for 2015 year model made me really irritated. I also wanted remote monitoring in smartphone, door unlock/lock. A new car for 77 000 eur and  getting the old system in the new 2015 model. Very bad"

welcome to deadly himalayas
My sympathies and prayers are with schmidt family. Their concerns are justified. I don't know maybe this is some sort of tradition for mountaineers or locals but it is completely impertinent to dramatize the remains of people's loved ones.
great stuff thanks for the share
Respect !
It was horrific. Had nothing to do with the memorial pile. This was edited. Shame on Mercedes Benz.
"Agreed,  impossible to make out any human remains. Video however was well done."
Looked at this video twice and can not see any remains at all -- just a pile of burial rocks--- what's all the fuss about ? It appears at .25/.26 that an attempt was made to bury the remains-- and all you can see is rocks-- certainly not a decomposing head.
"Dear Mercedes Benz,

I have Mercedes Benz and drive your product everyday.  I am appalled that you would sponsor a video that publicly displays footage of the remains of loved ones who have perished on the mountain. 
Shame on you! 
Shame on your brand! 
 I urge you to show respect for those of us whose loved ones still lay on K2. 
Respect those who are grieving. Edit out that disgraceful footage.

Daughter of Marty Schmidt 
Sister of Denali Schmidt "
"Dear Mike Horn,

You don't know who I am. However, you climbed with my father and brother on Broad Peak in 2013.
Following your recent K2 expedition you posted a video to your facebook page of your gallant effort to attempt a summit of the ""mountain of mountains"". Having been in media for many years, I understand why a recount of your expedition in a short video can be beneficial for building your name and brand as an explorer.
As you well know, in 2013 my brother and father were killed in an avalanche on the ""mountain of mountains"" and their bodies still lay there, never having been brought back to those who loved them most.
Today I watched your video, and was horrified at the image captured at .25/.26 of the film. Not knowing whether or not that was a member of my family, my heart stopped and my eyes instantly filled with tears. I want you to know that this is a complete and utter disgrace! I am appalled with your lack of respect for those of us who are still attempting to make sense of our grief.
No matter whose body was captured at .25/.26, I am asking you to remove this image at once!
You have children correct? Please ask your daughter how she would feel if this was your head decomposing on the mountain and was put on a promotional video from another climbers expedition. Now over 87,000 people have viewed this morbid footage. This horrific image will be indelibly imprinted in my mind. Is nothing sacred anymore?
We all make mistakes in this world, but I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to please correct this mistake. Respect the families and loved ones of those who have perished on this or any mountain.

A grieving daughter and sister,
Sequoia Di Angelo"
"I have saw the beginning scene in another very hot film,do you?"

"Chav German pile's of utter rubbish. Imagine telling people you had a Mercedes they would laugh how embarrassing. And it gets even more ridiculous with AMG utter chav tat from the comedy country Germany , what can you do but laugh at a German car. Imagine the fools at AMG thinking that putting a 50 litre engine in Ka was a good way to make a fast car. AMG how pathetic and so embarrassing allways a good place to go if your bored and there isn't a comedy program on, a Mercedes Dealer so reliable these piles of German tat but enormous comedy value . Imagine the Chavs you could spot at a Mercedes Dealer mullets galore and sausage giveaways, easy way to start a conversation with a Mercedes owner is by asking them if they are Avon reps and enquiring if they got their suit from Mr Byrite . Tremendous comedy value Mercedes Benz . Das ist scheisse"
j'adore la AMG c'est la meilleure
I don't think the AMG GT is fast enough as it looks huge and slow in the open road. Need something that is tuned and lightweight like a Evo or Civic Type R.

Always the innovator! 
"Only Mercedes Benz has the knowledge to make any other manufacturers new releases of their new vehicles look old school.  But I have to say, in my opinion that the E Class should have their own look and not look too close to the C & S Class.  One other note,  in all the previous E models there has always been a headlight design that has a twin headlight look even on the current model.  This model looks like to move away from that design in which it separates it from other models.  The front and rear light clusters seam to have the same shape as the C & S.  In my opinion its too close.  It kind of reminds me of what Audi do with there models as they all look the same with not much differentiation.  I do believe that each model needs their own look.  There has been plenty of times with a quick glance at what i thought was an S Class, was actually a C Class.  I am not saying that's anything wrong with that as they are the best looking cars on the road at this time, BUT i think the E Class should have it's own look."

Was für ne Hipster-Pfeife
I saw this movie many times - SLC is a predecessor of next generation of famous coupe - so SEC (C126). Anyway simultaneously there were two models of 107 - so C107 and R107 - unfortunately SLC (C107) is much less popular like R107. For me both models are nice. I have SLC 450 from 1975 and SL 450 from 1972. Both are waiting for their better time - both needs serious restoration. One day I will start both projects simultaneously. Now I am doing another car. But when I saw your movie I will try first to complete SLC first. I fully understand your love to this old MB model. Generally speaking after w124 and w126 reliability of this brand was lost for ever. What is a pity that today MB is not build by technicians and engineers but like other brands by book keepers trying to save money on everything.
"I have the '80 450sl. I absolutely love it! I drive it every day. Though not a 'pristine' model, the paintwork is so shiny the glare hurts your eyes. I look around at new cars and their new paint jobs don't come near to mine! The window glass, when clean, is so clear you have difficulty seeing if the window is up, or is even there at all! The window washers are adjustable, as are the wiper blade holders, for precision washing. The car handles very well, gets me out of trouble as fast as I can get into it. It has saved my life three times already due to it's amazing stopping power, not needing as must stopping distance as other cars. Around here people cut each other off a lot and slam on the brake and run stop signs. I couldn't imagine being in a different car!!! I will get a diesel one day to add to my garage. People always compliment it and offer to buy it!!"
i have one :) 1980 tho
"Endlich mal jemand, der DAS AUTO wirklich einmal so interpretiert, wie es die germanische Seele wirklich fühlt: Herz und Seele; kein Gestühl mit dem man banal von A nach B karrt, sondern in dem man quasi wie aus einem in Stahl und Leder gegossenen Gefühl, dahingleitet. Die Wahl eines solchen Automobils ist logisch, weil die Wagen heutzutage genau das nicht mehr vermitteln. Für die gesunde deutsche Seele muss ein Automobil einen gewissen metaphysischen Wert haben; in diesem Sinne kranken viele Menschen leider an ""Toter Seele""."

Mercedes (*_*)
So will this feature be in the US?
Will this work in my CLS  (2015) with Keyless go
The car is revealed in the app itself look closely !!!

In case a cockroach comes and sits on the sensors what will happen. Will the Blind Spot Assistant glow ?
"In a new 2015 e-class cabrio this system is disappointing to some extent. Red warning lamp in mirror flashes waaaaaay  too late. If the car knows by radar that some car is approaching with a lot higher speed it should give red lamp warning much much faster and not when the other car is passing me, 30-60 km/h faster. Jt should calculate that lane changing at100 km/ when other car is coming closer at high speed.Such false feeling of control and safety could lead to serious autobahn accident when somebody changes lanes too late and other car hits it 60 km/h"
"I have this feature on my GLC but I have a question, what if you are at a parking lot and the roof height is low will it automatically stop ?"
Does it work in the Indian model

hi
"I don't have ""traffic sign assist"" on my 2017 a250 sport 4matic in Australia, annoying. is it just disabled or not available?"
"I have a 2014 A45, currently don't have this feature. is this feature available via software upgrade or needs a seperate module ?"
Amazing.. nobody is driving the car! :-)
A very useful feature indeed. Is it on the C class 2016 Coupe?
when the road sign first appeared in the distance. i thought it was a nazi sign
I love the technology and innovation. But personally I would always turn these features off or just not get them in the first place. I prefer to drive myself.
"I have 2015 e250 cabriolet and wish to comment that unfortunately this system, with active steering ( in e-claws) does not always work. My car is 5 months old and I hoped I will get the latest distronic software but strangely sometimes it can see lane changing without indicator and sometimes, most times its blind. Mercedes, will thensoftware in my e-class be updated during next service check or not? Does Distronic need to beswitched on for this to always work or what?"
can i disable this function. it is scary making a left turn with the engine off
I love you
Is it possible to update an A180 model 2013 with this option?
Is it possible to update to the new command system on a CLA 200 urban 2014?

This is great!
I am about to purchase an old spec 2018 A180d MANUAL. Will it still perform this being manual?
Does the GLK 220 CDI 4MATIC 2013 facelift have the option of perpendicular parking?
Do you still have go brake&accelerate?or did you remove your feet of the pedal as well??
"Thanks for the info, so to confirm, perpendicular parking will not work on my 2013 A45 AMG? - only on the newer 2016 models? thanks!"
"I have a class but can not get it to do perpendicular parking, only parallel, do they all do both?"
"Just like the night stalker,shiny in dark and runs like the wind."

Did Mercedes seriously give the ok to this horse shit video?? I don't think so.
Great review Yasmine! Very tempted by one of these.
"You spelled the Name ""Kitzbühel"" exactly right. That's impressive for an English speaking person. Greetings from Austria."
"Un reportaje 📹 muy bueno, fabuloso, qué decir del coche. Sin palabras. . . bueno éso que es un Mercedes no? pues eso, jejeje, ñamñam, 🍷 🍷 ok? 🌹 un saludo"
Where was the off road?!? The GLE is nothing more than a heavier and more expensive E-class. And that interior design with physical buttons is so dated! You got rid of it in the S and C class why give it to the GLE and GLE coupe? Why?

I love your review. You have the right energy.
nice GLE!

Mercedes-Benz always has the most million-mile cars.
You did not show the odometer??? That would have been more convincing
How do they know it is truly 1 Million miles? The mileage counter would probably say 999999 but they didn't show it in that video. 
I think the New V Class will not be as strong as the old ones .
"Wow! 1 Million miles. Well, Mercedes Benz"

"Admit it, as much as you love Mercs new curvy design direction, this particular model looks like a Hyundai."
"i really hate the floating touch screen, its like an aftermarket LCD display or tablet attachment.

i hope not all new mb have this."
Price?
"The presenter needs to turn things down a notch or two. Pretty intense! :)

Still not feeling the ipad-esq display as now the trend for the current MBs. Not sure what market research was done to suggest a tacked-on aftermarket-looking screen was more desirable than an integrated one."
I like the idea of the Mercedes-benz reporter and top marks for doing this. I think the presenter could be slightly toned down. Being a British presenter but full of American sales ptich is very confusing!
"Gla, A class, Cla class = Exact same front and interior, C class and now the glc are also copies of eachother lol, no inspiration lately?"
Torie is my fav reporter!!!

great ad love it
Pretty dumb.
kars don't kick cars don't punch I thought a better ad warrernjamesanderson
This was dumb
I didnt get it
great story would have been better with a fighting scene where she beats up a group of men instead. Better special effects in the fighting scene music in the background is too loud. those cars make serious noise in a basement parking lot but that was not shown in the video. Watch fighting scenes from a series called Into The Badlands to get an idea of what I'm talking about.
Can someone please tell me the model of the old ladie's mercedes?
so they fight over one spot when the chase each other the parking lot is completely empty
This one is really owful!
"this was one of the stupidest Mercedes advert ever seen!!! What you show is that Mercedes  is not a car for sophisticated people - it is the brand used only by stupid, brutal without any social inhibitions people - stupid... very stupid one!!!"
The worst MB commercial ever...

"When I think of Mercedes, I I think of the mafia, not some dumb bums fighting like this!"
Its showing how the s class cant cover up the sound from the outside....

"does this means that this car is easy to steal? i mean come on, a little girl stole it"
What the song?
Mercedes is really out of touch with its consumer base compared to other brands. 
i'd like to see a movie from this
"Oh dear Mercedes, you actually pay people for this??? No fault of Dennis, it's the ""thinking"" of a clearly retarded marketing department. Can you also, in your own words, explain to us all why ""the KID"" left her clothes at the end? I do not want to buy this car after watching this ad."

"we have thousands of sprinters in Chisinau, working as minibuses for 0.164 US Dollar per passenger."
"Google currently uses 64 sensors on its #driverlesscars to map itself out, whilst safety is their prime concern.

If we replace the humble truck driver with automonous technology, we should at least train good people within the Industry, how they can have security in the workforce understanding and maintaining system controls.

Inevitably at one point, human Interaction may become as part prerequisite in the reshaping of the motoring Industry, and real lives and family Income will become dependent as both worlds collide.

On Safety and Insurance, both may benefit in leaps and bounds with automonous driving, with global savings and Investments, the flow on effect, may help the states fund new building programs that would otherwise remain on hold.

Yes, there may be wide sweeping incentives across the board as we look at how technology will assist our species adapt, but we must never forget to include the human element in the way we advance the technologies."

See.  It waited for the pedestrian to cross the entire crossing. This is ridiculous waiting. She was well clear of the car before she reached the other side of the road.
Forever por siempre Mercedes-Benz

"can't wait for this ..
especially in rush hours :$"
while watching this i farted and my farts smelled really bad but nice video though
I still prefer the trend towards more assistive safety features to a completely automated car. Something that can prevent/correct human mistake instead of complete driver replacement.
That floating screen science fiction marketing shit is really annoying. Interesting video though. 
Wonder what the race mode would be like...
Theres vehicles are factory or do they have after market modifications?
this a competition only for ladies :D

M.A VERY NICE.
"First you bought Mercedes, then you bought Apple Watch, so now, finally, you can get yourself some pizza! :)"

Respect for the hardworking people!
"Total respect for these people that work hard everyday to keep our cities clean, not only in Germany but all over the world."
"This attitude is gone from most people in Canada after NFTA and most good hard working type jobs in manufacturing went abroad to Mexico, Asia and elsewhere. Hay When the Canada EU free trade agreement is up and running with the clause for open bids for municipal maintenance, road works and so on, maybe the Germans can export this cultural notion of respect for more than just the Riche along with the high quality production goods we know and buy. Maybe......"

"People are getting mixed up with a camper van and a motor home. The van in Europe is ideal as most  sites you visit have showers and toilet facilities on site. The camper van is a glorified Tent looking at it crudely. 
        I have a Marco Polo which I swapped my VW California for, both are great at what they do, it’s just the Mercedes does it better for me, plus it’s longer. Camper vans are just easier to pack up and move on, but they should not be compared to the large motor home they are completely different markets."
I  likat  this  car
Beautiful Video
tough decision merc Marco Polo or VW California? The Marco Polo is luxury but very new. The VW California or any VW campervan is been around since the 1950's and it's quality.
Don’t go for the Marco Polo. The bed is bad! On our trips it went broke and we have to buy spare parts every time we went on travel for over 400 euro!
Very Good.😁
You never washed up.
52.000 euro ...Its better to buy  a second hand van and convert it to a camper van with few thousands euro.. So simple.

well this is nice !!!
air matic ist schit
Could the gle make self parking if I have the Assistant pack???
How does it works^^?
Now to future cool Mercedes benz never stop to give us something new and futuristic
Isn't this fascinating!
If the future of car technology is already there then I don't mind it.
lol people say this is boring but so is your 2002 civic
That car would suck if you’re in a hurry
not boring
The future is awesome
How do you do animation??
"Gday from Tasmania!  Your work is fantastic!  I wonder if I could use some of your clip as backdrops for a home-made Judge Dredd movie my son and I are making?  It's just a dodgy thing using iMovie and an iPhone, nothing special.  Thanks!
REPLY"
Awesome !
You really know how to capture emotions
"موجود الكلام دة في مصر 
انا عندى سيارة  نفسة 
كل دة موجود في مصر"
murphys law all over this commercial
SICK!!!!
Woaw Mercedes-Benz is very optimist!
"This is how I imagine future would be! love it, can't wait for it to happen!"
Good..............
Thanks this made my day
"We have to stop spending so much money on wars to be able to afford as countries any of these things, i.e. clean cities, solar paneled streets, self driving cars and parking structures like that. But it'll never happen most likely."
And here's me with a beat up C Class that doesn't even have an aux port...
Resume: pre safe break
Prem
"The A class series is style over substance.Its uncomfortable firm expensive not particularly practical and not that great to drive. The materials used inside are not as good as Volvo and it is not as safe either. However, it is a good looking car"
"It has space for you because you are around 160 cm, but real men can't sit in the beak seat."
This is gonna sound wierd. But she looks great in that car. have a nice day.
"The interioor sucks compared to the A-B classes. I don't get why its so bad, its a baby c-class and yet the interior is like old style cars, i paid $53k for my CLA250 and just checking the bclass and aclass models the interior is just amazing compared t the cla 250. Just disappointed that other classes have the c-class interior while the actual baby C-class doesn? wtf who designed that."
0:40 Tractor starting up or Mercedes-Benz?
Давидыч уже не тот.
"Get a 2015 Mazda 6 Wagon 2.2 Diesel-
MUCH better interior, bigger wheels, WAY faster, better looking, has more tech, and it's more reliable. - all for HALF the price


Mercedes is dreaming. it's got hard touch materials, noisy cabin, and a base PATHETIC engine."
Is this available in The nordic countries ?
it looks sooooo good!
"I wasn't quite convinced that the Shooting Brake would actually be an option when it was first introduced, but she as a reporter is just awesome and somehow convinced me that it is a nice car though. Did she say there is more space for the driver though? I'm 195cm and the CLA always seemed a little bit short :(... might the shooting brake be an option for larger drivers?"
"If it were not for the charming lady presenting the Shooting Break, this promotion video would be the least viewed video for she gets away so magically while rambing about the space, technology and power without mentioning any numbers at any time!! Awesome!! "
Is it a sporty station wagon? 
"Without sounding sexist (which, this inevitably will), this lady is a brilliant automotive reporter, sounds excited and incredibly interested. In other videos I've seen, females reporting on cars feel a little forced.

The car seems really nice though, loving the red accents on that sport model."
"Is this going to be available in the United States? CLA 45 AMG Shooting Brake? Mercedes, please!"
I prefer this one than the coupe and Torie is gorgeous.
I hope that the new mercedes models will be unbreakable like the old ones.
Add for shooting brake doesn't even show off the boot and it's space which is what makes this different to the standard cla...
I like Mercedes-Benz TV: Sporty and luxury: The new CLA Shooting Brake. Mercedes-Benz

Absolutely mesmerizing!  Bravo!
"Very good job. Mercedes ""the best or nothing"". Greetings from Spain."
lol only germans could say something is really exciting with a straight face
Thank you for publishing.
"Disappointed that the last 10 minutes turned into dumbed down, American style documentary. The rest of it was good."
"You can tell this is a translation from German. Great vid, but Mercedes: next time, give me a call, 'cuz your translation needs work."
I drive a 1985 Mercedes Benz 300D although not super old I do love the car and its quality
it's this kind of stuff that made me want to become a mechanic. too bad these days no one cares about quality anymore its just how fast you can get a vehicle in and out of the shop and not pay attention to detail. as long as it runs who cares!
it is good to see this is wonderful car is not forgotten
simply an amazing production with exretordinary people that share the same passion for the automobile.  what a treat this was.
Amazing film!!!
spend the time to watch this. The car grows on you.
"Thank you for posting!  Does anyone know why Mercedes-Benz Classic, themselves, did not do this project from start to finish, entirely on their own?  Was it more expedient to sub-contract it all out?  I am certain it was not a question of adequate financial resources."
"Feeling and emotion through engineering, excellent documentary! upload more material like this!"
Outstanding.
dat dashboard
Ausm.Very touching.Undoubtedly - Best or Nothing
So how come Europe gets the luxurious interior and signature dash & console yet American version is stripped down and dash and console is cheap and ugly. They don't even offer the upscale model. It don't make any sense that they are not the same across the board. I think the commercial van should get the hideous interior and the upscale should be the nice one shown here in the US. I feel so left out. The cockpit is a deal breaker for me.
when the AMG packages release date for UK buyers ? I'm looking forward to buy one .
When will the sunroof (preferably Panoramic) be added to the regular V-Class' list of options?
Pls bring this to asian market!! seriously need this!
A bit posh for all the mess and other things that come with family motoring

"No mention of the Second World War strange. 
The fact that Mercedes and BMW and so many other manufacturers of this Time took advantage of the concentration camps doesn't seem to get mentioned either. I wouldn't want to say something bad but factual. There were many great cars and drivers none of them slowdown in the rain. You just can't put the power down without being reckless. Whoever made the documentary clearly loves Mercedes Benz rose tinted glasses, Over the top marketing made to look like a historic documentary."
Thank you very much for uploading!
"I agree. The only car company with a history as illustrious as this is Alfa Romeo. Who I fan more than Mercedes, yet will agree that Alfa's story only comes close, but still behind this one."
Mercedes Benz....nothing else even comes close.
"that was truly driving by the seat of your pants, with no computer aided stuff to help you at all!"
Wow! What a great documentary! Fascinating! One ode the greatest race cars and drivers of their era! Thanks for sharing love it every minute of it👍
Fantastic docu - a masterpiece of automobil history !!! THANK YOU !!!!!!

"The maximum speed is 185.57 km/h (with compressor) and 167.97 (without blower) only! That's a shame for Mercedes 540K of that time, even it has Cx 0.362 and 180 HP! Alfa 8C 2900 LM Coupe Speciale Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera with almost twice smaller engine (2.9l) could reach at least 220 km/h. By some rumors it reached 240 km/h at Hunaudieres straight. Even without compressor the maximum speed was 181.818 km/h (III Chilometro lanciato a Roma, 12.09.1948). Tires were Englebert in Le Mans and Pirelli Corsa in others at least ninth races. Cx was 0.427 in ""Le Mans"" configuration and 0.37 in special ""maquette"" configuration (aerodynamic research made by Pininfarina, 09.07.1987). 

And the question. Why the Mercedes design copied Adler of 1937. Is it means that the body was designed by Paul Jaray?"
Wow! Very awsome! I like it when people don't only concentrate on the future and give what has happened in the past some deserved attention #Mercedes Benz
But it could easily be beaten with today's cars
"Bin gerade so stolz auf unsere Firma Sindelfingen. Wir bauen gerade die schönsten und geilsten Autos.

when you know nothing about car you take the C350e this end is a joke....190 Evo is a very expensive Legend and the noise OMG
190e EVO 2👌
you definitely choose wrong lol
its still not an 190 Evo II though
The epic video
The New C350 has parts made in China. The 190 is pure German(Europe at the very least) and will still be running on the road 20 years from now.
190e is true german car
"So wrong!  definitely choosing the 190e evolution.   style , class, value only go up, heads turner every time.  Need I say more?"
Old one LIT New one SHIT!!!
190e best car for ever
"HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA no.





 EVO all day"
"Ask Damon Hill or Reto Meisel to test or review yours toys into corners cf:(Damon Hill make me sick) xD

Hello mercedes benz azerbaijan 👍👍👍👌👏🔥❤
Зўр гап йўқ!
the C350e will never live up to the legacy of the 190e you cannot compare a legendary car to a regular car.
i love 190 so much
190😔👍      350💩👎
I wonder if I can handle the three of them
Nice

So, if I see you coming the other way, I'll wave, and I promise, you will know it's me......."
the bla bla is great. forget the car.
"Wow. dumb talk and music, no sound of the car. That's a straight and immediate thumbs down."
No sound of the engine?
absolutely beautiful motorcar
"""Fastest vehicle in the world"", ""first aerodynamic""... Steam-powered ""Stanley Rocket"" did 127 mph in 1906 and get crashed in 1907 doing around 200 mph... It was really aerodynamic. No radiator, no gearbox, no gear change lever, no clutch, no U-joints and all such a stuff. Direct drive double-acting inline twin, slide valves and variable valve timing... old-fashioned fire-tube boiler wrapped with piano wire. That's it. But Blitzen-Benz was the best in internal combustion world, nevertheless"

"Another very disappointing commercial-film by MB-G-wagen. This not have anything to do with off-roading. They try to present off-roading (and. of course, driving a G-class) as a thrilling thing, but off-roading driving hasn´t anything in that line. Driving that way in mountain conditions like that, is suicide... I can´t believe that, in order to ""marketing"" a product, that is presented as something that´s not real. I cant´believe that MB is doing this... They should be presenting off-roading in the way it is in real life, or at least at the way it should be, apointing to safety and environmet-friendly thinking and driving. Off-roading it is not ""Paris-Dakkar"" in every turn of every corner and every place... This is pure non-sense... This seems to be made by a bunch of fan-boys... (sorry if I been rude)"

How willing cuz I can't stop praying to God to make me meet this Mercedes Benz company. My big dreams in life
Where's the airbags
ВОРЫ!
nice but no because the reason y kids get attracted to the normal cars is because those cars r fun to drive but these new cars don't even match the name car but yeah as I wanna say these luxurious cars look like alien space ships no offence and there's not a lot of sit so yh bad future tech.           MY OPINION
we will need to much money
So Mercedes have finally created a bus that looks like a chrome vibrator on wheels. I can't wait to see what the future will bring! Hopefully time travel machines because good lord I wouldn't want to stay there.
This is so damn cool.
When will the car come out 
"Impressive but not quite there. It needs better touch displays, the doors take too much time to close, the laser feature and loudspeaker are nothing but a nuisance, and it still needs windows that can turn opaque for those of us who belong in the mile long club. "

Well that was a very misleading title.  I kind of expected to see this thing in motion.

"Hi Mercedes Benz,

Just about those front seats. The way they rotate to face the back, if that were to operate in the car when in motion or stopped, wouldn't the driver and passengers legs make contact in an uncomfortable way? Or do the seats do that before entering the F 015?

It's a beautiful design by the way! :)"

"So, what is the next technology?Flying car?"
"I have just bought the new Mercedes s500 and I am absolutely loving the intelligent drive system,it's amazing in traffic.its worth it 🇬🇧"
so crazy! Can't even imagine that!
"what about the obligation, who is responsible for hurting other traffic user by accident when the car drive itself? the driver or the car?"
Mercedes once again taking the lead in innovation. simply amazing!
The automobile will be eventually an AUTOmobile
This is what evolutionary algorithms/robotics are made for!
I still can't imagine that my car could drive by it's own....that's so incredible! :-O
Awesome.

A very nice video from a very nice car brand and a very sweet lady :)
I can feel the entire force of the Mercedes-Benz marketing department force feeding her every single line. If her dialog was any more rigid and scripted she would be on an American sitcom. Yasmine must feel like a bit of a marketing puppet.
Heck ?
"4Matic is an incredible system like no other.

I live in Canada with very harsh winters where roads are covered in sheer ice from time to time.  With previous non-Mercedes vehicles I have owned, a lot of wheel spinning and lack of control, especially on steep hills and my steep driveway.  With my 2013 ML350  4matic, no spinning and just climbing through sheer ice roads on steep grades.  Unbelievable.  Now, I know that not all all-wheel-drive-systems are created equal."
The CLA Shooting Brake looks great.
CLA Shooting Brake > CLS Shooting Brake
Yasmine and the GLA! :-)))
Mercedes-Benz is the best! No other luxury car maker can match their quality and prestige! 
What an unbelievable season! Congrats to Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes-Benz!
Mercedes forever different
i like the music. it's darude sandstorm isn't it?
"Macklemore, is that you?"
I feel disappointed in you Mercedes that firstly you replace the SLS with the GT and now call this a starring role when it shows up for less than 3 seconds. Now take some passion and inspiration from your rivals at BMW because they make more exciting and persuasive short films
"So much noise in life and all you need is something quiet; video so complicated, all I need is something simple. That's what I got out of this."
13/100?! o.O

"This video is not that hard to understand. The important entrepreneur gets put up in a hotel, travels around the world, wears nice clothes...and has a band accompany he everywhere....yet he couldn't grasp modern luxury and what it is. He asks the chauffeur what he could possibly know about modern luxury....the chauffeur says a lot because he is driving a Mercedes. Mercedes is modern luxury! The main guy in the video couldn't grasp luxury because he hadn't experienced driving a Mercedes. "
I want 4 minutes of my life back! 
The clip was to represent the car as modern luxury to him. In the video he was out of date didn't you hear him looking for a pay phone and the band wit old suits and stickers on there instruments. At the end he gets into the modern luxury world once he entered the car wit a chauffeur
What was the point of the girl?
Am I the only one that doesn't get anything from this short film? 
"ok it was creative and I think I got the message they tried to communicate to us, BUT it was way to long in the mid term.
It completele lost all of my attention in the moment he starts to run through the hotel and it came back when he sat down in the car, all in between was a waist of my time."
Wow! Thank you for this creative and inspiring video

What did i just watch?
"I've just purchased a 2015 C-250 and WILL be turning this off....

Am I to assume my speed and location will be constantly logged, ergo if I have an off or accident my data could be used against me (if I was speeding etc)...?"
Why do the windows not fully close ?
?  fi  di
Tbh I expected this standard on mercedes cars
how to turn it off permanently  ?
"Would you please clear me a doubt related to braking system ?
If we induce a heavy braking force it will lead to loss of traction,and if we choose ABS to assist our car, it will also increase braking distance .
what's more beneficial and how could we design our car stop soon after the application of brake."

Really the wifi Option is just a gimmick on the Mercedes Benz Infotainment. It does connect to the WiFi network but the pages don't. I do have a fast wifi connection. Also the Android Auto Option is also useless . Pretty much dependent on the Infotainment system itself
I have a GLA
it is included in all GLA models or is an extra feature?
Mercedes I love you
Mercedes has hijacked my subscriptions page

 👍👍👍👍👍"
cars made in china only available in chinese martket.
"Born in Beijing, and moved to Canada :D..Mom has 2 Mercs in Beijing, and I just bought 1 here in Canada :D....I love what Mercedes has became lately, the designs are much younger than before....Mom bought the 2011 E, and she likes that one compare to the new one....and she said...the new one is for me not her anymore (younger :D)...keep the good thing pumping!!!! will always have at least one Merc in my drive way :D.."
Just love the Mercedes-Benz
"great starting scene, with a bentley in the back."
"R&D, production and marketing..everything is moving to China"
I’m not in the market for one I’d rather have an A Class
"My grandmother owns a 2013 B250, and its a pretty good city car; small fuel efficient and easy to see & park. The 2.0 Turbo engine is quite gutsy for stop and go work too.

My biggest complaint is the standard RFT tires; feels like the car rides on rocks not rubber. Also a B250 4matic will sell like hotcakes in Canadian winters. PLS MB."
We love Yasmine :-)
"the ""reporter"" actually sucks ..."

Nice everything but a bathroom very nice though
Finally I received an reaction from Mercedes. They not going to help and leave us with a camper in which we can not sleep.
"Kiss your guilt goodbye in the name of Mother Nature........ We make a twelve cylinder s65 AMG, with one million horsepowaaaaaaa!!"
More powerful than you may think....5 seconds later.....turbo 4cyl diesel. Oh please...
"Not only the bed is bad but also the service. Mercedes Benz let me know, in a reaction on my earlier comment, they are sure the problems will be solved, but one week later, after sending photos there is still no reaction. Yes, when you buy your Marco Polo at 80.000 euro, they are helpful, but later is service also important, especially if you cannot sleep on the bed in your camper."
Don’t go for the Westfalia Marco Polo. We have one and the bed is not strong enough. During our travel we could not sleep in it. Some parts are to week. Westfalia does not help and Mercedes only sell spare parts. 36 euro a piece excl taxes (21%) and till now we needed 12 of them. We don’t dare to go on a journey annymore.
"Okay, i'm sold; but as an older person in her mid 60's and married, just where is the toilet, and how do you use it if you're in inclement weather?"
I hate thisl car
"For all of you American fans of the Marco Polo:

You can now get a MB Metris Camper Pop Top conversion by Sportsman, Tourig, and GTRV. You can see their videos on Youtube "
"""The engine here is more powerful than you may think, we are talking 4- CYLINDER TURBO DIESEL!"""
does the second van can fit 5 persons in it?
"I can not sleep, you made us like kids crying for my toy, that's not fair🙏🏻😻😿"
"Hi
Please I follow in love with Marco Polo, I am in market to buy a camper and that's best for me, Would you please let us know if I can come over to Germany and buy this car and take it back to Calif, in fact I know they are selling this car as a Cargo and Passanger Van,  is there any chance that I could bring it back to USA, please help me with more information, I am currently driving Sprinter and I love it too, but this Marco Polo is a killer in US."

"The designer said well, ...go for the bigger engine! The reason is quite different and logic: it's a real mercedes engine! NOT  a chunk renault one! it's a shame mercedes is loosing the shiny star and quality moving towards Renault cheap solution only for profit!
I still drive a mercedes vaneo, but now I'm gonna change for a bmw sport tourer or a vw sharan!  At least they cost german and are build german ! "
When will these be sold in the US ?

Mercedes-Benz brings the performance and efficiency from the racetrack to the street setting new standards and drawing advantages from the technology used in Formula 1.
not so reliable for Lewis Hamilton.

"I used to be a hardcore BMW fanatic, now I'd love to settle with a Merc."
"Hi Mercedes
Im an engineering student, what will it take to work for you?"
mercedes benz the best or nothing :)
Merc History is automobile History........MERC the BEST !
Great legends and great drivers.The Mercedes Sauber and W196 are the most beauty cars

Anyone with one of these manage to get similar mpg?
Most of those miles was with the car sitting on ferry with engine off.
I own one fantastic car and very light on diesel 5 litres per 100 km at 120 kmh
What soundtrack is that starts from 4:01?
"Having a 2014 E300 Hybrid estate , I was very interested in this video , However I can confirm , although the car is an outstanding piece of engineering , The video fails to mention , this particular car is fitted  with the optional 80 litre tank not the standard 59 litre as fitted in 90% of E300 models . It is not mentioned any where in the video and I had to research the web to confirm this. Incidentally the overall range for the estate  should be in the region of 800 miles , the most I have had from mine was 560 miles  or an average around 47 mpg not the 62 mpg factory quote ....no idea how they managed 73 mpg as they achieved on here ??  , is a great luxury barge though"
I don't understand how??
Nonsense . Never as I'm driving one
2000km (btw at 2000kg's weight) wtf??? Cant believe it
what was the avarage speed in km/h of the trip excluding the ferries? 70 or 80km/h?
"Awesome car! I bet a lot of R&D went into making this.  Diesel + Hybrid is the best combination, it just costs more to make."
"Incredible !!! 
E klass
The Best or nothing !!!"
"Incredible !!! 
E klass
The Best or nothing !!!"
"Zero dislikes, wonder why"
"I cann't believe that 
What a car !"
i need this please
oh WOW
Perfect combination of Diesel and Hybrid......nicely done.......!!!!!!!
and i thought mercs were horrible for mpg
MERC THE BEST ! ! !
i have 2014 E 350 it is the best thanks mercedes

The sculpture wonderfully shows how Mercedes benz has evolved over the years. Thats why its called Das beste uder nichts.

Shame you are developing new technology to improve safety yet leave W204 owners with windscreen wipers which don't clear the screen and simply say it's a known design flaw to which there is no solution!my 20 year old saab can clear the windscreen but that seems too difficult for mercede to achieve!
I love star-Cars :-)
Currently available on the CLS only ?
This innovation is why I decided to go to Mercedes-Benz and not infinity or Lexus. Great job and keep the innovations coming.
just amazing tech!
wowwwww the best or nathing

Beautiful!
"Oooo come on Mercedes - don't slide on the same slope as BMW calling every minor changes new generation :(
A pair of head lamps and new steering wheel is not new generation! It is just a facelift!"
One of my favorite Mercedes' but why Mercedes still insists on that i-pad looking monitor.  Nobody likes it.
Good job Mercedes. The new CLS looks really nice.

He wasn't wearing seatbelt?
So epic 
Perfect!!! I love it!!!
"They are joking, what does the display mean, is this Tesla or what. Dear Benz pls compare the way the display of the BMW 6 looks like and then see what you have done. In the end you buy the CSL (E class) with the interior of the C class...."

My favourite
Please sell this in America!
It looks more like an E class.

The turbo animation is wrong
W05 technology is sick. Dominating F1
Fine work Mercedes!
"despite the fact that it sounds shit, the technology behind it is still amazing."
I bet active aerodynamics would save more fuel than that though.
Mercedes located MGU K and aspiration turbine  front of the engine and waste gas turbine on rear and located gearbox front than traditional. But this video not description that point.

Хочу такую.........
Guess I wonder if safe rules on highway police aloud these kind lights they stop ones on Honda year ago. On there cars. And SUV.  Have poof ok in United States.  Sure don't want driver get pull over new kind lights.
Most innovative brand in the auto industry! They always come up with new and great ideas and their implementations
"I mean really people (all the ones asking what the purpose of these lights are). The reason the intensity of the lights lowers is to accommodate drivers following the car. During the day they are at their brightest, during the night (when they would be too bright for drivers following in cars behind) they automatically dim. Common courtesy from the folks at MB. "
"This is very clever and makes sense. To those asking why and what the point of this technology is, let me explain. During the day, when the sun is shining, the brightness of daylight reduces the visibility of a car's lights. Thus, during the day, the lights will operate at it's highest level of brightness to make it visible even in direct sunlight. At night, the highest level of brightness is not needed as the visibility of the brake lights will not be affected by bright day time light. This further makes it safer for other road users driving behind as the light will not be so bright as to ""blind"" them with such bright brake lights. Lastly, when the car has come to a full stop at night, the level of brightness is further decreased to make it comfortable for road users behind and not allow unnecessary brightness to impede their vision. This improves safety by making sure others can always see you braking yet at the same time not impeding others' vision by having the lights too bright at night. Think about looking at a bright light and then looking away; for a few seconds your eyes still ""see"" the light, temporarily impeding your vision. The multi-level rear light prevents this (thus safety for other road users too)."
much better ...
Awesome

Please bring this to America! I'm an suv guy but I would make this my daily driver since it's a German minivan not the ones you see everyday!! Please bring it to America! 
Will the V-Class be coming to the States? It would be perfect for my business as the Sprinter is a little large for our needs.
So nice. By far the best MPV I've seen in my life!
Omg the back of VW T5 Van and the Front of the Infinity XQ 56....what happend to Mercedes Benz?
"What the hell, a minivan seriously -.-"
Very good !!!
will it be coming to the U.S?
Cool! But the back looks like vw transporter
Will there be an AMG?
Looks cool. My favorite brand
"Really nice, Benz best car brand!!!"
"I love this guys voice!
Stunning car!"
"Stunning and Gorgeous! 
Totally redesigned! "
New ride for kids to go to soccer games?
Best or Nothing! Lovely interior... sexy exterior for a van... Mercedes has done it again! Its a segment Mercedes has bossed for all these years and they not resting anytime soon!
OMG !! It's very nice and luxurious
This is really stunning!!
"Absolutely gorgeous
The Best or Nothing!"
"Der sieht ja von hinten wie der VW T5 aus...
Vorne und innen ist er allerdings sehr lecker ;)"
WOW great !!
Rubbish
And it tastes horrible.
"Das Problem mit Afrika ist also gelöst, sauberes Trinkwasser für ganz Afrika indem Mercedes Benz jede Menge F-Cell Autos exportiert. ;op"
WoW
"Question 1: Can you still open the trunk if you put a water tank there?
Question 2: Does Mercedes Benz dealer put water tank for us, if we request it?"
"Too bad the amount of pollution going into creating the hydrogen to power this car is basically just as bad if not worse than powering it with Gasoline... But hey! At least you won't die in death valley!

Stupid marketing stunt... and poor uninformed film stars..."
Hydrogen Fuel Cel vehicles are a sham. Renewable hydrogen production is nowhere near economically feasable and won't be for some time. HFC is a diversion meant to keep us frakking.
"water. good.

carbon dioxide. bad."
Great adventure!  Great video! Great car!
"Très belle aventure en B-Klasse.
Plus d'info ici : http://repaire-etoiles.com/wp/4881/b-klasse-f-cell-diane-kruger/"
"I am all for Fuel Cells- (quick fill ups!) but unless the Hydrogen is generated by Solar, Wind, Hydro, Biomass, or LandFill methane- the net result is indeed a good deal of emissions from making the Hydrogen. Can't drink those Coal or NatGas power plant emissions... yuck!

If we are going to go for Fuel Cells- lets ensure the hydrogen is made sustainably."
WOW ... COOL 
What happened to Dunham? O_o
"Yeah, yeah, but this is DISTILLED water, it has no minerals, and you really shouldn't drink it."
"this is amazing, but only the rich would be able to afford this, if this was available and affordable for everyone, that would be wonderful"
"Distilled water does not have the salts and minerals an organism need. 
If the energy to get hydrogen is not from burning gas, that's fine."
"This water doesn't have minerals, so they would end up with none via urine.

Too many minerals in water is toxic, but just as pure water. Easy: They are drinking distilled water. Yes, the water which is put inside the lead acid batteries etc"
"So my comment was deleted Mercedes? too close for comfort.
Joshua you should know better than to support this evil.
There is a reason that us intelligent people support battery electric cars and shy the oil company lie that is hydrogen fuel cells. Fool cells is the nickname. There is a reason that oil companies back it..."

"i like the GLA, fun guy this Douglas !!!"
"I know what inspired the design...  The S class...  That's can't be a bad thing, except when it's a scaled down version, I've always thought, that one of the best things about Mercedes, is that every model had its own look...  Unlike Audi and BMW... "

Revisit all Mercedes-Benz highlights of the #NAIAS 2014 in one interactive video!
Going to the auto show.Can't wait to see this car
The only thing that looks better than the new C-Class is Kelly Rowland.
"S class its to expensive for me but the small s-class (C) its for me 
good job merc...."
"This waste of recourses will soon be dwarfed by news of earthquakes, pestilences & disease !
*Oh, & war ! ! !"
Cool..
Kelly Rowland <3
Amazing..!!
Very interesting!

"#CES 2014: in the midst of the gig and watt giants, Mercedes-Benz reveals its intelligent connectivity concept, based partly on the ability of the car to ""learn"" the driver's habits, preferences and predict his moves."
Can I please have my 600 S Class Coupe White with White interior... Thank You
I love u Benz 
The music is great! What is the name of it?
Speechless!
Nice one...especially the aerial footage.
"Without central differential, how could it possible to send almost 100% power to the rear axle?"
"hi, how do I tell if a cla250 is a fwd or 4matic except looking at the badge?"
Is it possible to get 4matic for the S 63 AMG Sedan version or is it limited to just the coupe/cab version?
Great! Now you the car shifts from 2WD TO 4WD in a matter of seconds and that too without the intervention of the driver. Just amazing. 
"Put a button in the cab, selectable Fwd. Not the other way around. Else why pay the premium for 4wd instead of sticking to Rwd? There's no fun in Fwd. Safety, yes. Misuse of a concept your company has been the flagship for since the invention of cars. "
"but please make 4-matic with the manual gearbox as well :(
some people are not lazy drivers! Now Mercedes has attractive and very sporty models and it would be nice to have manual..."
Sweet ^_^
I like Mercedes Benz
CLA Is much nicer ;)
"I think the screen should be integrated into the instrumentpanel in this segment, the screen looks like a afterthought, like a aftermarket GPS, it looks cheap on a otherwise goodlooking instrumentpanel, and interior."
Great job Mercedes. Can't wait for the C63 AMG version =D
"I like the interior; massive improvement on the W204 (which I personally have C350). I like the front, but the rear light cluster looks questionable; maybe it will grow on my by time.

Now I'm trying to imagine how the C63 will look like..."
better than the old model
the newer cars look all the same..i prefer the c class before this one.
"It is not good like before.
"
the best looking C Class ever. Looks like a small version of the new E class.
My next car.
"Which to choose now, this new C class or the CLA ??"
MUCH more beautiful than the old one!!!! Great job Mercedes!!!
Love it S-class is to expensive for me but small S-class (C-class) would be nice and adorable for me :)
"Great improvement over the last C Class which had those cheap looking rear lights, this new version looks brilliant."
Very sexy!! 
Like it ! Cool looking C-klasse
Baby S Class
put the s-class grill on it.it will look even nicer
I like it.  Its certainly an improvement on the older C class that looked as if it had been designed by Vauxhall.  I also like those Bentley look alike rear lights. However the car would look more appealing if they were long.
The luxury looks better than the sport..
I miss him too much :(
Stiiiiig.... You are coool...
I miss him
"get well soon schumy, i am sick of hamilton"
"we missed you very much, the champion. I know a miracle is needed however hopefully you get well soon. - a hakkinen fan"

"Does the braking system take into account the weather conditions? I.e. While braking, if the car goes over an ice patch, does the system change the direction of the car?"

Cool

Mercedes best ever 
Hakkinen is awesome!!
"My first car was a 88 190E with a rear spoiler and plad/leather bucket seats. I later owned a 300CE amg, i just love the square styling, If i ever find one in a good condition i defenetly want a 190E cosworth. "

That view at 1:44 gave me butterflies in my stomach
True Car Guys will focus on the specs she's talking about. Others will understand nothing at all cause their focus will be on Torrie...
"1.17 to 1.34...whatever she's selling, I'm buying!"
1999 S class still the best.
Torie is really hot. The S Class isn't bad either.
Merc. S-Class the king of all sedans!
салон просто сказка) и ноги красивые у девушки

interior is shit ! 
"Fast,can steer you the right direction, warn you when to stop...makes thing comfortable....all in the lap of luxury. Did I mention the car. lol"
"Nice tits 
"
"Wow, that's Incredible! So seductive, sleek, flamboyant and most importantly: Magic Body Control! Self-adjusting suspension is definitely what I'm after in a vehicle. I would love to drive that one day. Anyway, is that S-Class part of the deal or is that separate?"
Thanks for reviewing the car!
NICE! and the car is good too ;)
Wow

This is reasons why I love Mercedes
God created the human but German created the machine
What if i tell you that a 2003 audi a8 has this?
Mercedes beans why don't you make your cars more reliable
Try to know . What is benz
Copied from the bose car
I took a look at the car configurator for the s560 4matic but didn't see any option for magic body control. Is it now considered as standard or is it no longer offered by Mercedes-Benz?
This is copy by citroen ...
Awesome tech..... Really bad name for it
even without the magic body control the ride of w222 already better than 90% of cars in the market~ and now probably 96% with the magic body control
Volvo can do it better
Mercedes-Benz is where SkyNet will become aware :P
Not available on a 4matic s class 😂
there goes the whole speed braker concept
The Best or Nothing.
I bet It would never work in india

W115  -  W123 - W126  aynısının yenisini yapın lütfen.bu arabalarla yaşamak gelecek nesillerinde hakkıdır
e300td turbo 4matic the best
"W124-it's just a wonderful car! This year my Mercedes turned 23 years and we also went around the 4 on it and so the two circles! For the whole trip 2 torn tyres and fuel system restore after Ukraine. It is the eternal car, thanks to designers!!! Good luck!
  W124- это просто замечательный автомобиль! В этом году моему Мерседесу исполнилось 23 года и мы на нём тоже объехали 4 страны и так по два круга! За всю поездку 2 порванные автопокрышки и восстановление топливной системы после Украины. Это вечный автомобиль, спасибо конструкторам!!! Удачи!﻿"

"car of cars#111111
"
"how much?
"
"Absolutely love the new one, just like the older ones. Though, I think some of the assist features would not work in developing countries where their driving style is different. Mercedes shsould be paying attention to that."
Just as if the Old Model wasn't evil enough... 
Amasing car wonderful craftmanship
Amazingly beautiful
Just … Astonishing!!! 
"Does it the same in the market
It is more higher ( in this model) than those in the market?!"
"its soooo beautiful...

A Mercedes van towed by a Dacia Duster... I think this gives more publicity to Dacia.

"its what makes it unique, yeah buying tires would be a lil expensive but absolutely nessarary"
"I hope they drop it down to 4 wheels, 6 is silly outside of a post apocalyptic world."
It's awesome
Mercedes -Benz ist für mich das beste auto und ist es auch :D
"One good reason to buy OEM wipers, instead of cheaper ones found in every supermarket is the tiny Mercedes logo on each wiper. I love that... Instead of having some random company's name, you have the Mercedes star on your wipers!"

What music is that?! it's wonderful <3

Almanlar beceriyor be. Alman arabasının üstüne tanımam!
We're good auto G63!!!!super MAN auto!!!
That's why Mercedes is the greatest in the world ...love you Benz...
Arguably the best offroader in the world? It's practically based on the technology when it was introduced in the the 70's!

I like the wolf

": , )"
i love it
Love this commercial. Perfect match- car and wolf. And a great beautiful car.
My Machine.......CLA 200d Sport.................
This was used for our music assessment and I want a Mercedes now
The wolf seemed to really hate the Mercedes...
It is like buying your pet wolf
Ya en iyisi yada hiç 👍
didn't get the whole wolf thing.
so i guess I'm the only one who jumped the first time the wolf barked all crazy..?
crikey! those headlights are GOgeous
wow~~~~

"Found my next car, for real!

"waiting for coupe if available in short future :P

"Mercedes' designers are on fire at the moment, the last Benz I really liked was the E-Class Coupe, this is something else."
I like the look of this Benz!

"
Super einfach Super

Nice

"I Want it!

"

who else noticed spiderman @2:39? :D
Did Wagener drop a hint? New G in 2015? :)
Love how she talks about law enforcement and spiderman just casually walks by
"I love Torie <3
"
spiderman <3
but why so round shaped? Mercedes! stay with your Mercedes habit and don't make a round shaped car.
E Class will always be my favourite car. The new one with the sportier front with big 3 pointed star in middle of grill really looks great.
Does anyone know what is that square in the front grill (00:39)?
My favorite car had been Audi A6 but now is Mercedes E class. No doubt!
I really do like the one witht he classic grill. Hopefully I'll see more of those on the road.
"the ""old"" e-class has launched in 2010"
I suspect this is one of the many new beautiful cars Mercedes are set to debut. Nice job on the E-Class   
why god dont send me one arab bilionaire as a friend who can buy me this for my birthday :(
"A NEW1 ALREADY? how old is the ""old"" e-class? damn time is running"
No wonder my dad has been visiting Mercedes's dealership quite a few time recently -____-
Sweet Mercedes E Class.
wow what a beautiful design it means that Mercedes-Benz has a new type of dcar
Mercedes technology brilliant!
MB always overtaking all other cars brands by tech meaning
"I love my 2008 Mercedes Benz E350 4 matic, but it doesn't have these what I call ""idiot features"", I wish it did.  Even though I try to limit it I might be a idiot at times. Mercedes Benz always one step ahead!"
It's like  Mercedes themselves say: The best or nothing! BENZ 4EVER! 
Mercedes is the King of the Germans!
Mercedes is and was the best
"impresive, thats what usually we expect from Mercedes..... Alwayes and just the best"
"love it, but can't afford it >_<
"
I'm very exited about this.... autonomous cars incoming in a future near you!
Amazing mercedes >>>> always innovate 
I like the addition of not allowing overtaking - clever benz :)
oh god i wish i have distronic plus
Ilove benz
How it works in winter? :)
Love it!
waiting a new s class! with all that safety systems
kool animation
It's good that y'all care about Mercedes owners driving safety
"Mercedes-Benz The Best or nothing.
That`s we expect from Mercedes for everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"

S class is the best! :)
Nice one day no one will be able to drive properly on their own.

Fashion is her passion and so is mine
"to Steeevyo who sent me a private rude message - You think I'm an idiot because I wonder how she says she ""loves"" animals yet wear tons of fur.    You are the idiot if you can't see that obvious point.    Idiot?     You not me."
I met her!!! She smells like sweet delicate Gardenias! She was magical :)
Wise woman..and incredible open...:-)

i make cars of clay but nearly as great as this
What kind of clay they are using i want to learn and starts. For.making my own design
Now how would one go about getting into this area?? Anyone
was the car modeler the actual car designer
Not Mercedes Line
May I please know how can I get into this? An intern? I'm in the OC County in California. I know Mercedes has a facility located in Carlsbad.
How can i start my career as car designer
What is the name of this song?
do any of u know. ? what is that silver color sheet called.
I think my mouth was open for 1:49 mins !!
"ABSOLUTE TALENT HERE! wonderfully made video, love the music as well!"
"so cool.i very like car design, and want to be excellent color&trim design."
damn
"It is wonderful in the way it manufactures something so beautiful, just imagination vortex of ideas out perfectly, really love me .. Greetings to all of the creation of such a beautiful piece .."
too nice
Wooow the music is soo brillient!!!Lved it..
How'd they do that?!?!
wow !!!
this is brilliant
"Question I got, how come there's only funky colors on this car? Like the steel blue in this vid, or the ""High-visibility jacket"" color (as quoted from TopGearUK)?"
This video is great! The shots and the camera movements are smooth and nicely done. My compliments! 
i love mercedes

"good work mercedes
"
Can't wait to see this car in the USA!
Well would have been great to see the AMG Electric drive in action to experience the Sound in and outside the car :/.

Amazing Car !!!!
"Evocative, exciting and inspiring can only begin to describe this video.

A BIG thank you to Mercedes-Benz for bringing these cars to Goodwood. Amazing to see!
I so wanted to go there !

"Hi, how do I apply to become a truck driver for your team?"
"pls take me in ur team

"We make Mercedes , others make cars.
From Kuwait with love."
"the best or nothing . With Mercedes always better
So my opinion
I love cars Mercedes because of the beauty of the design and the ultimate in comfort and high quality
But unfortunately I can not buy them because they are expensive, a dream of my dreams, have a new Mercedes
The biggest dream that the company has


Thank you very much

i am from K.S.A"
Splendid!! 
"brilliant, absolutely stunning. "
why not to apply this magnificent idea at M.B. agencies
That's very cool. I always loved the idea of automotive furniture. Wish I could own some of this.
It's good that Mercedes Benz is continually working to put in additional features that can prevent accidents from happening. Learning from accidents and the nature of them is a good process that any car manufacturer should work towards. 
"I'll be a Mercedes fan maybe for ever,when i watch MB videos where they say that their car saved a human life i get goose bumps and i get proud that i am a huge fan of the best car company [for me] -.-"
"Very important!!! Congratulations Mercedes, I
'm your superfan!!"
"This would definitely pull my caravan and look great on the campsite, I want one"
"ME GUSTA ESTE VEHÍCULO
"
"Well, what else could you expect from Mercedes?"
+mrontheotherside lol yeah
A for action-packed
This is what all comercial should be like even washing machine ones like you have the slow part of the song when you put the blocks in the wachin machine then when te water flows have the beat drop imagine that XD
The song is Audiomachine- Guardians at the Gate(Access Denied Remix). Jk its Darude Sandstorm.
Audiomachine-Guardians at the Gate (Access Denied Dubstep Edit)
"Audiomachine, good choice."
@itiooh: Thanks a lot for da song name! Peace.
Came just looking for this. Thank you very much!
33 seconds of pure orgasm

A Class-commercial. Cheers!
"Thank you \m/
"
"I wanna drive this car with that amazing dubstep song crankin.

This car! that music! it gets your pulse racing. Amazing commercial."
"amazing car, one of a kind,very strong body and good engine 
"
"Hell yeah! Mercedes Benz does not only make the best cars in the world, now they made the best car commercial ever! das beste oder nichts!"
"COOL
"
The only commercial that i've ever searched
 Best car commercial ever <3 LOVE IT!
"""A is for A - Class"", that gave me fuc*ing orgasm
"
"If i could affort it i would buy it perhabs, just because of the commercial. Gj and nice taste of music"
Song is Damien Damien - Y Shape
so much beautiful car can you give the song name please???
"Is this song made for this video or can you buy it? If you can buy it, could you please tell me the name? Tanks! :)
PS: I love the new A-Class 3"
"Absolutely Wonderfull!!  Great car, really good girls and above all good longborading along the way.  You M-B made a hit here!!  "
Mallorca ♥!
Super Sache Mercedes Benz! Die Werbung ist phenomenal dank der Idee mit dem Longboards und den Mädels. 
"mainly cosmetic differences (rims, red seatbelts, different comand screen theme coloring, red contrast stitching in seats, gloss black side mirrors, spoiler, blacked out front grille). Although it seems on this vehicle they chose to keep the body color mirrors and front grille (I know you can choose which color seat belts if you would rather regular color, maybe the same can be done for other changes in the package).  "
"best handling in its class, i hope so!! "
"Why does this Video Have a dislike? 

This is truly inspiring. Killian, Keep going. 

Skateboarding is AMAZING. "
Ok
very nice!

Wow what an engine

Tysm Mercedes for this all detailing
الف مليار ممتاز وشكرا
Audio in LATINOOO PLEASE 🙏
Did anyone realized that he said 5.5 v8 natural aspirated engine. Well I guess the biturbos took a break than.
Ok
impressive but they could have done better
"That's really impressive, great job. Now we can drive naturally aspirated V8s 😁"
M156/M159 is my favorite followed by M113K.
ez igy nem jo
"wow, first I have heard of this motor. Nice that they changed direction from even smaller hot side turbo V8's back to normal aspiration, just like they went down to 3 valve heads and back to 4 valve. SBC electronic brakes back to conventional hydraulic brakes. 5.5L supercharged twin plug, 3 valve head M113 was/is my favorite AMG motor. sounds great and almost 520 ft lbs of torque to boot."
meh.. go electric benz
that technology is now in the suburban!!
"amazing, i love the cylinder cut off technology! one day i shall own a merc!!"
Same As Vvt-i mechanism
AWESOME!!
"Great engine Mercedes but 5,5 liter is far too big engine than one need in life. This just sucks fuel that is just becoming less of in the world."

I love my G wagon 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Great vehicle but MB needs to reincarnate the cabrio
looks like a land rover defender 110
"Mercedes Benz G Class, this is what I call an original car. With the history, the mb g class is capable going off-road with combing luxury in the car. Mercedes Benz G class, the longest living mercedes benz to be respected."
Respect Mercedes Benz

Respect to G-Klasse from MB Owner...Cheers as always my friend.
Less is more.
"Fantastic SUV, nothing like splashing in the rain and snow while everyone is driving at 30 km/h - it's not for the faint of heart nor conformist.... The G has a massive cult following and will continue to do so for many more years to come. Nothing comes close to an AMG G Wagon. "
Yes it is! OMG Cargasm!
"Is that the CLS 63 AMG Shooting Brake in the video
"
"Mercedes - Benz Coupe Kombi :)

Awesome car and i will buy him :)
"Great CAR :)
"
"great
"
"Classy. Looks much better than ridiculous new 1 series of BMW or Audi's A3. I hope pricing will be alike those two. More to it, when we compare this car to the older A-class, there is a HUUUUUUUUUUUGE improvement in terms of design. The car is evolved into an agressive hatchback from a crappy minivan-style car. Great job Mercedes, great job indeed."
they celebrated their 125th anniversary a couple of years ago now. that is a major milestone for any company. 
"First Comment, Benz made the first car right? Not sure but i'm pretty sure that they actually did."
"The car look good, I hope the rezults will be verry gratifying. AMG force! Mercedes Force! "
"dafuq, a SL 63 with 5,5 liter engine :/"
i have seen the sl 65 ! 
Whats with the SL 65 ?
Dear Santa...
"Oldest brand, Best brand!!!
"
Nice video
"Gullwing doors, whilst a Mercedes unique feature is not something that is an unmistakable element of a Mercedes-Benz. They're just unmistakeable elements of the 300SL and SLS AMG. 

However, there are some design features that are common in Mercedes cars, and which contribute to the brand image and a Mercedes being a Mercedes.

The four eyed look actually started in the w123, but let's not forget square lamps, short front console, long bonnet, delicate chrome trimming or the flat boot.

i love mb but anyone would know kids would sound that thiled driving threw the cource in a 81 toyota soooo

"Who is driving?
Talk about a wreck looking for a place to happen."

You should be focusing on driving not looking around and doing other stuff while you are behind the wheel.
que bonito
Mercedes Benz are always my favourite.
"Please, Mercedes, don't cancel the G-class. The outside is truly beautiful, just work on the tech and luxury and you'll have a winner ( and not just for ""Beverly Hills types"" ). I'll be out of college in a few years, and I'd really like to be able to buy a new and improved, G-class SUV."
i Love Mercedes  Benz <3
"MUSIC : Sezer Uysal : shine ^^
& i looooove mercedes-benz <3"
"Wow, nice one! I still got my 2006ish ""C"" class, and really love it!

Innovation bildhaft machen!
just Amazing ! 
Very cool. Should do it for all cars. Another alternative to a catalogue/brochure and you can customize the car to what you want and buy it.
Seeing Kris fall is a nice reassurance that he is human. 
Kris Hom is best
"@InjexDnB I call BS, There are tens of thousands of people who ride. Great snippet Merc, love ya Kris!"

@Pretz1123 i believe its in California.
where is the classic center
Nice! I like!
I would absolutely LOVE to have a job there.
I LOVE THAT CAR !
is an impressive work!
"I appreciate that the restorers in the Classic Center recognize that the classics they work on are fabulous they way the were/are, and you don't need to modify it in order to make it relevant today.  Moreover, Mercedes' commitment to their heritage, as shown by their Classic Center and their parts department that lets you get almost any part you could ever need for any of their cars, is a model for others to follow.  Keep it up Mercedes, I can't wait to have one in my garage!"

How do I get 1 of these calendar?

I know it from my own experience in 15 years this car never let me make felt like, ""i'm not shure in ""him"""" my W123 1977 always ready to go.

Francis thanks for doing what you're doing for MB and us - those fans like me, of MB"

I would love to own one.....:) Hut ab fuer die Qualitaet...
When are these cars going to turn affordable for a third world country like mine? :(
It is very attractive. Just one suggestion: graphics on lettering inside the video is old style. Why?
"one word ""awsomeeee!"""
are people really going to want to use a interface that is a built in part of the car as opposed to using their actual smart phone in the palm of their hand? i would like to think yes but I'm sceptical. i wonder how much research and statistics went into the development of this idea. 
"A parking app that synchs with your phone would be GREAT! How about another app that displays the total of your electronic toll tag, that would be very handy!

p.s. Love the new B-Class, it looks good!!"
A movie app would be awesome!!
"Class leading infotainment solutions :P

Extremely lucky to do what they love to do !   Way to go guys !

Very Nice! It looks like a small car with a lot of sport and quality!
Are you hiring in like 10 years?
"Then, what do you guys want old people to drive? There would be an increase of people above 60 in the future"

"It would be cool if you added an invisible camera at the back of the car for viewing it on the iPad while parking.

Another cool future  would be to build this car as an internet hotspot amplifier. I'm serious, tethering internet using your iPhone and car. The car amplifies your signal for ultra wide range and would even allow rescue-workers to have contact with eachother in hard to reach places with no cellular connection."
Epic.love my iphone4
Those screens are really hard to read!
love you
I love it!  Please bring it to the U.S. UNCHANGED!
"Hi JJ, like your video"
bald werde ich das teil fahren ;)
Thats the first pretty A-class
i hope they fix how the text is displayed on the screen.. looks hard to read
Gefällt mir sehr gut diese Integration des iPhones. Die kommende A Klasse hätte diesem Konzept etwas mehr ähneln können.
"for the LOVE OF GOD, please, plEASE, PLEAAAAAASE, bring this to productivity and don't let it as a concept idea.I'm sick and tired of seeing you companies (and i mean ALL of the companies) making concept cars and none of it seeing the light of day...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO IT!"
So futuristic but still classy !
"The developments for the ""digital natives"" are wonderful, keep them user friendly for the older customers too (such as me.:-).  For th younger set, Mercedes can benefit by really reconnecting the young to Mercedes heritage... a young friend recently told me she respects German engineering (she drives a VW) and Mercedes were nice, but sadly, she said, Mercedes Benz isn't German (!!!).  Don't laugh, she is college educated and not the first young person I know who has told me this."
"It's my birthday!!

On another note, is that a Fisker Tramonto at 3:23?"
Oh man! It's incredible! God bless him!
Amazing Mercedes just amazing... 
"Very amazing

"What an amazing guy. I couldnt fix a car and im 20/20! My Grandfather was also blind from a cannon misfire in WW2, and he could also make his way round an had a certain amount of independence, but nothing like this guy. Remarakble. I wish him every success...although he seems to have it already."
Bravo for that men. he WANT to live the life. bravo :)

Bring this grill in all the MB vehicles
"So wonderful, when it could public sell?  I got CLS but model a is really dream car."
put it into production straight away
Jaw-dropping gorgeous! From concept to actual delivery please don't change a thing.
When can i buy one?
That grill is the most beautiful thing I ever seen.. too bad it probably wont be present in the retail version.
"Mark
This is a fabulous car. You have done amazing things with it. I've been looking for a car with style that isn't too big and haven't seen that many! I'm sure it will be a great success. Of course I want one first!
When is it available? And of course what will the price range be?

"god damn that 6.3 sounds nasty , but i like it"
how much do they go for
I am buying a 1984 or 85 300d sedan almost mint condition from a older lady in ct. 79000 miles !!! thanks for the videos !!!
"Very nice, I drove a W115 240D-3.0 for years back in 1980. Great engine, the kind of engine that only stops because your fuel tank is empty... I'm European and we could not get the same luxury outfit (big bumpers-transm.) as for the US.
I swapped the car because of corrosion problems to a W201 190D-2.5turbo in the year 1990... That was my last Mercedes car."
I drive a W126 (1988 420) - Daily driver in the rust belt for pushing 30 years....still going strong (with only a little rust.... which I promise to correct this summer!) and it's gas!
I have precious lovely one (W115- 1972 -230-4) wow i like.
Cool. Do you have a restoration video that have you done?
"A real enthusiast, we love it!"
Anybody who has the passion and love for these old Mercedes Benz's is an outstanding person in my book.
"Back in 2014 I bought a 76 240D manual with 210k miles for $1000 from an old guy that couldn't drive anymore. My goal was to learn how to work on cars. That goal was never achieved because that car never broke down, not a single hiccup. I ended up taking things apart and putting it back together just for the heck of it. With 62hp I had to hustle that car all the time, doing launches at every single red light or stop sign to keep up with traffic, cruising at 110-120 kph on the highway daily (top speed was 138 kph and it could still reach it!). In the back of my mind I always knew that at some point something was gonna break because I wasn't ""babying"" it by any means but it never did. I drove everywhere during summer and discovered my parts of the country. I ended up learning how to work on cars from the constant issues I had with 90s-00s cars that I owned through winter ironically.."
the best or noting
We have three 230E's : two of them are W123's and one is a W210. Truly GREAT CARS!
Does anyone know the song starting at 0:42?
"C'mon JG, it was Daimler who said ""the best or nothing"" not Benz. 

Also, to the other commenter, the red sedan in his shop is a W123 and there's also a red W100 600 SWB in there too. "
AWESOME VIDEO.... I JUST MOVED HERE TWO WEEKS AGO TO FINISH MY DEGREE FOR TRANSPORTATION DESIGN.... I'VE WANTED TO DESIGN FRO MERCEDES SINCE THE AGE OF 9..... MY FATHER HAD A MERCEDES BUSINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA.... SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE..... NOW HERE IN PASADENA CA.... TO FINISH AT ART CENTER..... SHOOT ME AN EMAIL.... WOULD LOVE TO MEET.
I do believe that Mercedes built cars that last a lifetime before the 90s... and this is probably one of the testaments to that remarks...
nice car...
"W115 red is beautiful!!
Soy de Costa Rica saludos!

"Love this video, very cool"
"We have a 1983 230E Merc(123Series) with 144 000 km on the clock :) . .Doesnt run alot .Even though the car turns 30 in September , the engine is stil as good as new :) .. .Never had any problems ,just tires and regular services :) . . .The best or nothing <3"
Love the documentary and your passion for MB! I drive a 1980 300SD with 260K on the odometer.
well i just think that what do its awesome and i just want to say that thanks for inspire me even more to keep working on my 1982 merz 240D here in Los Lunas NM and maybe one day drive to L.A and ask you for some advises and get some of does mats...
Lindos autos
"I bit of exaggeration there.  My SLK allows water into the cabin while the roof is closed.  No amounts of roof adjustments could help the situation.  Oh, and that diesel like noise on a 350 (M272) gas engine.  Other than that, fun car but I will not use it to commute to work.  I prefer to arrive to work nice and dry."
Very impressive engineering.
Thank you for posting this. This was so inspiring to watch. I SOOO  appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into making a Mercedes-Benz. Nothing but the best.

Wish they kept Franz Beckenbauer for this version as well. Still a great advert though
The music in the German spot is way better. But still great commercial!
"This was a great add! 
"
"That's an E class Estate and a W113 280 SL.

"What a splendid video, and the gentleman is right: they should be maintained, used and enjoyed. I had a 600, and despite being horrifyingly expensive to run and maintain, it was fabulous. I miss that delicious exhaust note - my reason for watching this delightful video repeatedly."
SUPER AUTO ...............
"Awesome monent, awesome car, and Elvis is still a legend. Thanks for share this experience with us."
"The exhaust system is surely not stock, I can't imagine a 600 sounding like a Chevy V8?"
Elvis has left the Grosser.
I love the engine noise
2.10 writed slow but car is very faster.
Awesome move.did it have a V8.
A non Caddy that belonged to Elvis? Heresy.
My 1965 600 SWB in away for the winter
Come back special ❤️
"It is not easily firing up and the exhaust is broken. Normally you can hardly hear the engine. It is at least silky as a Rolls Royce...
You should have serviced the car before taken it on Mercedes TV."
"What a delightful film, and a delightful man who is a true enthusiast.  This is an example of a great car falling into the right hands, which doesn't always happen.  The gentleman's comments on old cars and old trains is so apt.  And that exhaust note!  Delicious!"
"Thank you for sharing your car with us. There was just one Elvis, and the man had a heart of gold. He came from very little to make it big, and never forgot where he came from, no matter how much he had. I'd like to think he's with you. He loved his cars. All of them. - Thank you."
Glasspack mufflers? 
I agree it is a shame to lock them away...
A Jewel in the Crown!!
"her sound is so gorgeous, what a beauty, so impressive, lovely!!
"
"Awsome, no words....MERCEDES 600!! BEST CAR IN THE WORLD!!"

Why Takata so deadly because every time like a billion times takata got recalled because they kill millions of people because of there airbags
Never knew that
"Takata could make you to injury
Malaysia cars with Takata airbags cant renew their roadtax"
Audi is WAY better
*Im using Mercedes! :D*
Too bad Volvo beat you to 3 point seat belts.
Almost 40 years! he!
people have bad experiences with airbags. but at least it's better than to hit the steering wheel
The First Airbag is from VOLVO OK!!!
Um i notecid airbags are big in mercedes
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AIRBAG
I love Mecedes-Benz
"Wow

Mercedes is the best"
Happy birthday
"The inventor of everything automobile
 .         *I*
        *❤*
  *MERCEDES*"
The first airbags were installed on production cars in 1973 on the 1974 Buick Cadillac and Oldsmobile model
Les premiers coussins gonflables ont été installés sur des voitures de production en 1973 sur les Buick Cadillac et Oldsmobile modèle 1974.
happy birthday airbag🚘 🎂🎁🎉🎊🎉
"My Mercedes does not have an ESP or an Airbag. In the '90 you needed to pay extra for airbags, nowadays the benefit of airbags are very common, no one would ever renounce airbags in a new car. This was also typical for all other brands at this time, but Mercedes Cars are one of the only brands who live 25 or more year's.

"This is a very disappointing commercial-film. This not have anything to do with off-roading. They try to present off-roading (and. of course, driving a G-class) as a thrilling thing, but off-roading driving hasn´t anything in that line. Driving that way in snow and freezing conditions like that, is suicide... I can´t believe that, in order to ""marketing"" a product, that is presented as something that´s not real. I cant´believe that MB is doing this... They should be presenting off-roading in the way it is in real life, or at least at the way it should be, pointing to safety and environmet-friendly thinking and driving. Off-roading it is not ""Paris-Dakkar"" in every turn of every corner... This is pure non-sense."
💪
"Guys, most MBs from the past 8 years have their left/right fog lamp light up when turning left/right. "
"thats wat we call an ""OFFROADER"". best to drive in Himalayas 
"
There are not barriers for Mercedes Benz G classe!
"Super video!
"
When do we get the Professional in the US? ;)
My Dream Car
...and that's why they built it.
I want one of these so bad!!!!
Gotta love this merc.
Looked like a BlueTEC? Didn't know they made a G with that option. Wish they had here in US.
Its like a Bond movie!
Check out the G class page on Facebook. WIth the G class in snow.
"OMG, incredible camera, real pro driving and the car - This is THE CAR. "
"I like how one of the fog lights is out in the last shot...
Awesome truck though, would trade my E320 cabrio for one in a heartbeat."
i like the part when it drives through snow.
I adore this car. Grrrrrrr
0:57 omg nice car
This car is as elegant as functional!

Because seduction has to be flawless!
yup very nice

CLS Comes just under the S. Then comes C. Then G. Then E. 
"Mercedes Benz S class is the King of all cars.
C class the Prince.
E class the Prime minister.
G class the defense minister.
CLS class the secretary of state and so on!!! ;-)"
Who heard him say SL rather than CL at 9 seconds?
wow 
goooooood i love it
Very very nice!
Godlike car 
awesome!!
Sexy!!!
Best coupe in the world...
I love mercedes..............
Beautiful car! And it sounds amazing!
"CL 63, but 5.5 liter... i dont understand this"
Sexy! I love this car. 
 I want that car !
"why is it a ""63"" when the engine displacement is only 5.5L in that V8 biturbo?"
"Mercedes, rename this ""S class coupe"", ""CL"" dsnt make much sense..."
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaa
awesome merc forever!
Isn't it ironic to talk about fuel consumptions on a CL 63 AMG?!?!
Great Car!!!
Mercedes-Benz is the best car in the world .
<:O Woah!
the best or noting
"Hooray, MT 33! Just in time, I love these releases. Thanks MB!"

"look at the front of the sls amg ,you can find details from the legendary 300 sl gullwing 
both cars are awesome because both are MERCEDES!"
Thats one awsome car.
Na so dolle ist der Herr Schneider da aber nich gefahren... trotz Fahrhilfen :D

"I'd take the bike, any day."
"yes super coool 
"
If you rode like that you would not want any heat or coffee!
doesnt this depend on traffic? false advertising ftl
"This new E Class is a fabulously good quality car. Understated with elegance, which is what I like best. Mercedes Benz is always my favourite car. In the mid 1950s, I took a ride in a 180D Mercedes taxi in Dublin. The present E Class is very different !!!!   From that early day in my life, Mercedes Benz rather special to me. A wonderful car !!!"
11 miles long. I'm going to go drive this tomorrow.
I could drive this way faster on my C240 '98
angry roaring caRRRRRRR
Team Coco!!!!
"Hey Jay, wanna race for pink slips?"

"i want an SLS AMG

:("
@shavimusha So True!
nice cockpit
"they do have some stuff other than cars. check out there merchandise in their websites, you can order them online, or you can find some of them in your local mercedes dealer. I bought some shirts and bags and other stuff from their website in UK, and to be honest they are reaaly quality products, check them out :)"
the best or nothing
it looks like old time mercedes sport car.....
"Yet, another Retro car."
Vivaldi - the four seasons :)

Best car in the world
AMERICA TAKE NOTE: This is a game SERIES! Not a FRANCHISE. Mongs.
epic driving sim is gonna blow all other driving sims out .
it is viewable in GT5 Prologue.
"@sspope 
pc has the shittest exclusives though.
crysis is a shit game and only looks good if you got a top end PC.....which hardly anyone does. it even crashed the nasa computers."
"how much is the car in US dollars? is it one of those $150,000-$200,000 type of sports cars or is it like the $500,000 mercedes benz SLR?"
Great game..but cant buy it..i hava ps2 :(
"Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Fail. Fail. Fail.

""The PC was created for work. ""

^^ What kind of nonsense is that? Why do you think there are powerful video cards on PC? 

They're dedicated for gaming, as are multicore CPU's. PC can be whatever you want it to be. It's how you spec it.

As for the PS3 vs PC...........don't start with this. PS3 is already dated, just compare Crysis on PC and then on PS3, the difference is enormous."
yeah true !
"This show it to anyone who still believes that the PS3 is more powerful than a PC
PS3 tech 
CPu = IBM cell 3.2 Ghz with 512KBL2cache
Memory=256XDR MAin ram ,256MbGDDR3 V ram 700mhz
GPU=Nvidia RSX 550MHZ 
with this nothing to special looks like a normal setup of a low-Medium PC,with this PS3 Fan shut up.!"
"man you are very noob you don't know nothing about pc car racing games , difference are this ,Console have arcade game , pc have arcade game and  Real simulation about Cars Aircraft boats, because Pc sotware are programmed with real Physics, you think pilot of F1 or more use for training console ? are you crazy?"
the box does look a little big but it defo just has the 1
0:53 3 discs?
"GT 5 is a awesome game i think the other game makers will never catch GT because Gt has a VERY BIG projection ...
they made the SLS in 6 months/weeks that is awesome"
"at the start from ps3 ther were no games for ps3 ( the games was for xbox/windows technology NOW they start to make games for CELL TECHNOLOGY ..i want to see the graphicvs 1 year later i think i will say WOOOOOOOOOOW )
DONT FORGET the graphics from cryengine 3 are best on PS3 (the makers said that said couldnt make a good dynamic shader on pc/xbox because they have not enough power"
"gt 5 P uses only 30_40 % of the ps3 power and you cant play this game on pc ( maybe yes if you have a high high end pc for 2000 dollars ) 
i want to see a game that uses 100% off the ps3 power ! 

ps:i saw a 10 min long video from cryengine 3 ,the makers from crysis said that we have the best graphcics on ps3 ( dynamic shaderr is so rea lyou will never have a dynamic shader from cryengine 3 on pc maybe 3 years later lol haha )"
"what are you talking noobs ,shut up 
you cant compaire the ps3s power with a pc 
you can use a ps3 as a super computer 
i saw a research lab in usa they used big servers (12) for their work and now they use only 3 ps3s (they changed the power,now they use the power for their work and not for graphics :D ) 
i am not a fanboy or anything like this but the ps3 is awesome"
"this is GT 
more then 5 years WOW that is the reason why this game is so good
i think vever will be a game better then gt 
AWESOME"
"it's true ps3 has potential but only with other console , Pc it's another thing ,for example real flight simulator like Fligh sim series, GTR GTR 2, Crysis DX 10 version are for only PC because have a real PYshic ,thats are the difference"
"Destroy as in, far superior than a PS3. They have gaming computers that are freaking ridiculous. PS3 has 256MB video card, Some pcs have got like four 512mb cards stuck together. expensive as hell but truly amazing,"
meant that the PC as the power of mathematical calculation is much more powerful than a normal ps3 thats are the real pc gamer with SLI and Crossfire technology.
"Lol ""designed to shave off every hundredth of a second"" Who are you kidding, you mean designed to get as much angle as possible when drifting round a corner and that's what makes mercedes stand out. Too many cars nowadays are all about numbers (BMW, Ferrari). But Mercedes is all about the passion. I bet more time went into perfecting the sound of the engine and how happy the car made you feel when driving than into anything else"
Still don't understand why it has such an ugly rear! It doesn't make sense...too modern and boring.
"Love thic car. But, no money no SLS :("
"hi, what is the name of the track around 1.11?"
nice car
LOVE it. Worthy successor to the 300SL!!!
i liked the music playing around 1:11. I cnt wait until TopGear gets their hands on it.
I'm not a big fan of the MB but this is a good car.

"Completely unnecessary and useless. Why still are there so many beeps, chimes and music playing randomly?"
"Mercedes benz is a great car, I own a E 350 and I'm super happy with this car, I will never go back to Buy another car."
tech gone too far
i never knew they actually do this. thats that type of quality you get when you buy a mercedes benz
"Even my old W124 1992 E-Class has a nice door closing thud, and the six-cylinder petrol sounds the best."
only mercedes would make an electronic sound of an indicator relay.. :) i though have a real relay in my -83 w123 and i love the vault doors on it!
hey I do that too. and I listen when i close the door.
Best Car...just amazing!!
I AM A SUPER SUPER BIG FAN OF YOU GUYs
they forgot the beep the car makes whn u lock and unlock it (which is srssly the coolest car unlock/lock beep in the world) amazing Merc puts som much time in their cars. u get wht u pay for.
Hehe awesome guys !!! :D
sound designer，great job!
"Clearly NOBODY at Benz put my Mercedes Vito 109CDI through the sound test. It sounds like a cross between a bus and a tractor. Also, the vibration, Harshness and 'Boom' in the cabin makes it unpleasant to drive."
interesting
"i hav 2 agree, no other car sounds quite like a Mercedes, and theyve alweighs sounded the same."
"Interesting, but that friggin constant focus shifting was horrible."
yeeeeeeee
subliminal Maybach advertising anybody?..

Mercedes - King Of All Manufacturers
"me too, i just love the outside and inside"
it has it onboard.. it's an option when buying the car. that function is excellent
How bout Distronic Plus ?
"Don't let it depress you, it should motivate you into aspiring to owning one of these automobiles. They truly are fantastic pieces of engineering, and if you work smart, friend - one or several of these are at your fingertips."
this is depressing...because i don't have one
